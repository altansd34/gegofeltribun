As they rewatched Boyle’s audition, Cowell gushed over her unexpectedly powerful vocals.</p><p>“I was having a terrible, terrible day, and I remember saying, ‘I really, really hope she’s not gonna sing,’ because there were so many bad singers that day and I thought, ‘I just can’t take another one,'” he said.</p><p>Unluckily, Cowell’s hope wasn’t granted. Be that as it may, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boyle’s audition</a> wasn’t a washout. The singer managed to defy people’s first impression of her and stunned the whole crowd when she sang “I Dreamed A Dream” from the musical Les Miserables.</p><p>“Our expectations were quite low, but she is the perfect example of never judge a book by its cover,” Cowell said.&nbsp;“She is just the most incredible person. This was a lady who lived on her own in Scotland, and she came on the show and everything changed.”</p><p>The mogul went onto explain that up until that audition, people held unfair standards of who deserves to claim fame. But as he said, Boyle came to change the rule book “full stop.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-boyle-says-he-s-the-best-boss-in-the-world>Boyle Says He’s “The Best Boss in the World”</h2><p>After her remarkable audition on BGT, she had to get used to her instant fame. According to her, she took a while before realizing that “a wee unknown lady with a cat in Scotland” has already become popular.&nbsp;</p><p>When she returned for America’s Got Talent: The Champions, Cowell was blissful to see her compete again. Boyle later expressed her appreciation for the executive, saying he’s the “best boss in the world.”</p><p>“Simon is the biggest inspiration in my career. He’s been my boss for almost 10 years, and I strive to make him proud. He inspires me to continue and strive for perfection,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Boyle came back to BGT earlier this year, revealing she had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered a stroke</a> in 2022. Now, after fighting “like crazy,” she’s back on stage and ready to perform again.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_TheVoice_Blank_Generic_Keyart_NBCUniversal-220x147.jpeg alt="Which ‘The Voice’ Franchise is the Overall Best?
