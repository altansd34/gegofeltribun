Several new dates have also been added to the schedule.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-derek-hough-announces-rescheduled-symphony-of-dance-dates>Derek Hough Announces Rescheduled Symphony of Dance Dates</h2><p>“I am so thrilled to be announcing the continuation of my Symphony of Dance Tour,” Hough told fans in a video posted on Instagram Wednesday. “And this includes the rescheduled dates from December, and some brand new dates.”</p><p>Hough’s wife Hayley Erbert, who was part of the tour, was hospitalized in December and underwent a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">craniectomy and cranioplasty</a> after being diagnosed with a cranial hematoma. Hough <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled his remaining tour dates</a> through the end of 2023.</p><p>The DWTS judge shared that tickets for the December shows will be valid for the new dates. Additional tickets are on sale now for those dates. Several new dates have also been added to the schedule, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tickets on presale</a> now with the code DANCE.</p><p>Right now, shows are scheduled starting April 19 in Tampa, Florida. The final announced date is May 19 in San Diego, California. Both of those are rescheduled shows from December. The new tour stops include Richmond, Virginia; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Salt Lake City, Utah.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HAYLEY ERBERT CONGRATULATES ‘LOVE OF MY LIFE’ DEREK HOUGH ON EMMY WIN</a></strong></p><p>The poster showing the new and rescheduled dates for the Symphony of Dance Tour includes a picture of Erbert, and some fans on Instagram are wondering if she will be featured on the tour in any capacity. However, Hough didn’t mention his wife’s involvement in his announcement video.</p><p>Other fans are pointing out that April would probably be much too soon for Erbert to be back on tour after facing such serious health issues. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent update video</a>, Hough emphasized that Erbert’s recovery is “still a journey.”</p><p>Erbert told fans in that video that she was doing “so much better every single day” and that “there is so much progress every day.” However, fans probably shouldn’t bet on seeing Erbert dance with her husband on tour just yet.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Original_AmericanIdol_Hometowns_Disney_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Host Ryan Seacrest Reflects on Visiting the Judges’ Hometowns" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Derek Hough</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Hayley Erbert</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w56pnqNdnby2s8dmmKemn6q7pLHSZqmeq5OdsqXBy56bZpyRqbK0ecWoqWagmah6tMXMqZ%2BopqlivKd5w5qlnJ1dqby2vo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-beckham-only-has-one-child-he-doesnt-kiss-on-the-lips-816358.html><span>←</span><span>David Beckham Only Has One Child He Doesnt Kiss on the Lips</span></a>
