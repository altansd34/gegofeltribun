I just said ‘yes’ without reading the script. Ridley is such an iconic filmmaker, it’s an actor’s dream.”<p class=align-left>Speaking about his collaboration with Ridley, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Travis told<i> PEOPLE</i></a>:</p>I’m not a Sci-fi guy, so it’s intriguing. I didn’t need a pitch, Ridley asked me to do it and I was like, 'Yeah, of course.' Then I read the script, it’s very unique. He’s such a visionary, and I think it’s something no one has seen on TV before. He’s so creative. He puts you in an amazing world and he’s such a nice guy I loved working with him.<p class=align-left>Previously, Travis mentioned that he prefers acting in movies rather than TV series:</p>Quite often [in television] you’ve got to sign a thing for 6 years, and that’s a big chunk of your life to do the same thing. I’d rather do different things. There’s some great storytelling on TV because of the time you get to follow characters’ journeys. But yeah, I’d rather do a film and then go away and never have to do that one character again.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9afeb30bd7809772.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jake DeVito biography: who is one of Danny Devito’s children?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Which of Travis Fimmel movies have you already seen?</p><h3>Travis Fimmel movies and TV shows</h3><p class=align-left>The actor has portrayed many interesting characters throughout <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his career.</a></p><h4>Travis Fimmel films</h4><ul><li><i>Surfer, Dude (2008)</i></li><li><i>Restraint (2008)</i></li><li><i>The Experiment (2010)</i></li><li><i>Needle (2010)</i></li><li><i>Ivory (2010)</i></li><li><i>Pure Country 2: The Gift (2010)</i></li><li><i>Harodim (2012)</i></li><li><i>The Bayton Outlaws (2012)</i></li><li><i>Maggie’s Plan (2015)</i></li><li><i>Warcraft (2016)</i></li><li><i>Lean on Pete (2017)</i></li><li><i>Danger Close (2019)</i></li><li><i>Finding Steve McQueen (2019)</i></li><li><i>Dreamland (2019)</i></li><li><i>Here Are the Young Men (2020)</i></li><li><i>Southern Comfort (2006)</i></li></ul><h4>TV shows</h4><ul><li><i>Tarzan (2003)</i></li><li><i>Rocky Point (2005)</i></li><li><i>The Beast (2009)</i></li><li><i>Chase (2010)</i></li><li><i>Vikings (2013 - 2017)</i></li><li><i>Raised by Wolves (2020)</i></li><li><i>50 States of Fright (2020)</i></li></ul><h3>What is Travis Fimmel net worth?</h3><p class=align-left>As of 2020, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his net worth</a> is $3 million.</p><p class=align-left>Who is Travis Fimmel’s wife?</p><h3>Is Travis Fimmel married?</h3><p class=align-left>There are many rumours about Travis Fimmel dating actresses and models.
