She shared her struggles to&nbsp;accept that her husband turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mean. He&nbsp;constantly made comments about her body odor, which seriously impacted her <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a>. But she was absolutely furious when she found out the real reason behind his behavior. After hearing the details of&nbsp;his scheme, we&nbsp;completely sympathize with her.</p><p><h2>The woman’s marriage to&nbsp;her husband has always been wonderful.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7a/0a8/83de87590684a884f2aed206be.jpg><p>I think, I can never earn over which I paid by my precedent employer, but I was wrong, world is so large to try their fate. but now I am making $52/h even more,and easily earn minimum $1300/week, on the experience everyone must try to do work online, easy way to earn, here's an example.<br>𝐰𝐰𝐰.Richnow05</p><p>Lilly, a&nbsp;woman who recently wrote to&nbsp;us, sounded incredibly desperate about a&nbsp;problem she encountered in&nbsp;her otherwise happy <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> life. She mentioned that she and her husband, George, have been<strong> happily married for over ten years</strong>. During all this time, she had never witnessed any disrespectful behavior from George.</p><p>Lilly shared, “Honestly, our <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> has always been built on&nbsp;deep emotions, intense passion for each other, mutual <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a>, and trust. I’ve always seen my&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with George as&nbsp;happy; it&nbsp;was ideal for&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;has always been a&nbsp;<a href=# title=loving data-link=tag>loving</a> and caring husband.”</p><p>However, there was one thing that cast a&nbsp;shadow over everything: the classic tension between Lilly and her MIL. Lilly wrote, “I’ve always had <strong>a&nbsp;tough relationship with my&nbsp;MIL</strong> because&nbsp;I just don’t like her personality. She has always been very authoritative and entitled, genuinely believing that her opinion is&nbsp;the only one that matters in&nbsp;every situation. She loves to&nbsp;interfere in&nbsp;other people’s private lives.”<br>One way or&nbsp;another, I&nbsp;made an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;get along with her and always behaved politely. It&nbsp;wasn’t too difficult since we&nbsp;didn’t see each other frequently. George and&nbsp;I live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different country, so&nbsp;the opportunities for her to&nbsp;meddle in&nbsp;our lives were quite limited. I&nbsp;eventually accepted that <strong>my&nbsp;MIL would never be&nbsp;like a&nbsp;second mother to&nbsp;me</strong>.</p><p><h2>Out of&nbsp;nowhere, Lilly’s husband began behaving very disrespectfully.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b20/22e/ae194a5be586853caadf661d13.jpg><p>Lilly continues in&nbsp;her letter, describing how about a&nbsp;year ago, her husband’s behavior completely changed. She explained, “<strong>George started making rude comments about my&nbsp;body odor</strong>. There was no&nbsp;apparent reason for it—no changes in&nbsp;my&nbsp;health or&nbsp;lifestyle. Everything had been normal until one day, he&nbsp;just started doing&nbsp;it. Every single day, at&nbsp;least once, he&nbsp;would tell me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I stink and smell bad.”</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;the early days of&nbsp;their relationship, Lilly mentioned that she had always been diligent about her <a href=# title=hygiene data-link=tag>hygiene</a>. When they first met, she showered daily, used deodorant every morning, and brushed her teeth 3&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day. None of&nbsp;that had changed, yet George continued with these nasty comments over and over again.</p><p>Lilly admitted, “I&nbsp;got <strong>so&nbsp;paranoid</strong> about having body odor that&nbsp;I began showering <strong>3&nbsp;times</strong> a&nbsp;day. I&nbsp;started applying a&nbsp;special, strong deodorant <strong>every hour</strong>—I even set reminders on&nbsp;my&nbsp;phone. I&nbsp;also began using perfume and brushed my&nbsp;teeth <strong>5&nbsp;times</strong> a&nbsp;day, doing it&nbsp;every time&nbsp;I ate or&nbsp;drank anything besides water.”</p><p><h2>George’s comments took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;Lilly’s mental state.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ae/659/ed91625f52ab7918a2852340ec.jpg><p>For anyone, being told that they smell bad can be&nbsp;unpleasant. When those comments come from a&nbsp;loved one, delivered rudely and repeatedly every day, it&nbsp;becomes even worse. This was exactly what Lilly experienced, and she confessed it&nbsp;made her feel very distressed.</p><p>Lilly wrote, “I&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I was losing my&nbsp;mind. I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I hadn’t smelled bad throughout our relationship, and&nbsp;I didn’t think&nbsp;I smelled bad at&nbsp;that time either. But it&nbsp;was clear that my&nbsp;husband thought otherwise. I’ve always been the type to&nbsp;discreetly check my&nbsp;armpits for any odor. I&nbsp;even went to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;doctor, who assured me&nbsp;that <strong>there was nothing medically wrong</strong>.”<br>The situation got so&nbsp;intense that&nbsp;I began asking my&nbsp;friends and family to&nbsp;smell my&nbsp;armpits and give me&nbsp;their honest opinions about whether&nbsp;I had any body odor. Everyone reassured me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I didn’t smell bad at&nbsp;all. One family member even said that&nbsp;I smelled overly clean like&nbsp;I had just walked out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Lush store.</p><p><h2>One day, Lilly discovered the real reason why her husband insisted she smelled bad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7e/655/625c30513a9af7edbaeb95e0c1.jpg><p>One day, Lilly unexpectedly uncovered the truth behind her husband’s odd behavior. By&nbsp;that point, she had become extremely paranoid and wouldn’t even cuddle or&nbsp;kiss George whenever he&nbsp;claimed she smelled bad.</p><p>One morning, Lilly decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;walk while George stayed at&nbsp;home. She explained, “I&nbsp;told George I’d be&nbsp;gone for about three hours. I&nbsp;planned to&nbsp;visit my&nbsp;sister and thought a&nbsp;nice walk would be&nbsp;refreshing. But after a&nbsp;while, I&nbsp;started feeling unwell. I&nbsp;decided it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;best to&nbsp;head back home and rest, so&nbsp;I returned about 30&nbsp;minutes after leaving. Of&nbsp;course, George wasn’t expecting me&nbsp;to&nbsp;come back so&nbsp;soon.”</p><p>Lilly continues her story, explaining, “Because I&nbsp;felt unwell, I&nbsp;entered the house quietly, trying not to&nbsp;make any extra noise with my&nbsp;keys or&nbsp;anything. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;terrible headache, and every sound made it&nbsp;worse. George didn’t hear me&nbsp;come in&nbsp;since he&nbsp;was on&nbsp;a&nbsp;video call with his mother.” Lilly noted that George and her MIL were speaking very loudly, and it&nbsp;sounded like they were arguing. The loud noises from George’s room irritated her, and she wanted to&nbsp;ask him to&nbsp;use his headphones while talking. Then, <strong>she suddenly realized they were talking about her</strong>.</p><p>Lilly wrote, “George was nervously telling his mother that he&nbsp;was fed up&nbsp;with this ’<strong>smelly game</strong>.’ He&nbsp;sounded stressed, saying that because of&nbsp;his constant comments about my&nbsp;body odor, we&nbsp;had stopped being intimate, and&nbsp;I wouldn’t even kiss him anymore. His mother, in&nbsp;response, told him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;patient if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;keep me&nbsp;around. She explained that George’s father had done the same thing to&nbsp;her, claiming it&nbsp;was <strong>a&nbsp;foolproof method to&nbsp;ensure a&nbsp;woman never leaves</strong>. According to&nbsp;her, a&nbsp;woman would stay with one man forever because ’she’ll feel too low to&nbsp;cheat, be&nbsp;devoted only to&nbsp;you, and always be&nbsp;fresh and clean.’”</p><p>Essentially, Lilly’s MIL was advising her son on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;keep Lilly by&nbsp;his side, sharing <strong>the nasty tactic</strong> that George’s father had once used on&nbsp;her! Lilly found this disgusting and was furious that George would try such a&nbsp;vile technique on&nbsp;her. She concluded, “George doesn’t know yet that I’m aware of&nbsp;everything. <strong>I&nbsp;want a&nbsp;divorce, but&nbsp;I want revenge before&nbsp;I end things with him</strong>. I&nbsp;know that many people might not see George’s actions as&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious reason for divorce, but&nbsp;I can’t imagine spending the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life with someone who uses such ’smelly methods’ on&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman who loves him with all her heart.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6rq3DnmSmnV2lrrOtzaignWWRl7y2wIymsGaan5nGbrvDqKlmmqWperW0xGapnpmjpLtuw8eyZKGdXZm2pXnIrWSlnZapeq6xjJ%2BspqGenHp5fZhwbmln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./my-boyfriend-proposed-to-me-but-later-changed-his-mind-818524.html><span>←</span><span>My Boyfriend Proposed to Me But Later Changed His Mind</span></a>
