Amanda Stanton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab6/70a/a4c3fc561694a94facf19006da.jpg><p>Amanda Stanton divorced her first spouse while her eldest daughter was 2&nbsp;years old and her youngest was still a&nbsp;newborn. She had a&nbsp;difficult time complying when filing for divorce because she had 2&nbsp;children and was still breastfeeding at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>She was going through a&nbsp;difficult period but <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Being the best mother you can be&nbsp;and giving your kids the BEST life possible has nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with your relationship status, and you don’t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happily married to&nbsp;have a ’picture-perfect’ <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.”</p><p><h2>2. Mary-Louise Parker</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f82/bf5/85db3b5b939f630e8401714b26.jpg><p>Mary-Louise Parker has 2&nbsp;kids and revealed that being a&nbsp;single mother is&nbsp;tough but rewarding. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>, “Sometimes I&nbsp;just look at&nbsp;them and I&nbsp;think, you are the 2&nbsp;coolest people&nbsp;I have ever met.” She added, “I&nbsp;was getting ready to&nbsp;come here tonight and my&nbsp;son came up&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;trailer and said, ’Where are you going, my&nbsp;beauty?’ I&nbsp;hear that, and&nbsp;I don’t really need anything else.”</p><p><h2>3. Sandra Bullock</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91f/6fd/cb50fc5275a1f638ce9459500c.jpg><p><a href=# title="Sandra Bullock" data-link=tag>Sandra Bullock</a> went through a&nbsp;difficult divorce with her spouse, and she had one child at&nbsp;the time, but years later, another child entered her life.</p><p>She was concerned about being a&nbsp;single mother, but despite that, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>she said</a>, “It’s just like being a&nbsp;mom&nbsp;I finally realize, oh, this is&nbsp;what&nbsp;I was supposed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;when&nbsp;I grew&nbsp;up. Not be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom, this is&nbsp;my&nbsp;purpose. My&nbsp;priorities are my&nbsp;kids, my&nbsp;kids, my&nbsp;kids. My&nbsp;family. My&nbsp;family. That’s it.”</p><p><h2>4. Sheryl Crow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e7/8d3/e515fb58f89e60fbde034230af.jpg><p>Sheryl Crow has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2&nbsp;sons</a> and admitted that she did not want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother at&nbsp;first, but then <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “To&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;just say, you know what, I&nbsp;feel a&nbsp;motherly instinct and desire for children, and I’m gonna row the boat halfway, and we’ll see if&nbsp;it&nbsp;comes and meets&nbsp;me, and it&nbsp;did. Sometimes taking your perception of&nbsp;the way you think your life is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;look, taking that out of&nbsp;the picture, really does create so&nbsp;much incredible opportunity.”</p><p><h2>5. Katie Holmes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f99/ad0/94a7e9593ba12beac5fb587743.jpg><p><a href=# title="Katie Holmes" data-link=tag>Katie Holmes</a> has one daughter, and the love between them is&nbsp;unrivaled in&nbsp;this world. Following Holmes’ divorce from her husband, she managed everything on&nbsp;her own.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>, “I&nbsp;love her so&nbsp;much. My&nbsp;biggest goal has always been to&nbsp;nurture her into her individuality. To&nbsp;make sure she is&nbsp;100% herself and strong, confident, and able. And to&nbsp;know&nbsp;it. She came out very strong, she’s always been a&nbsp;strong personality.”</p><p><h2>6. Connie Britton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/031/bee/7ada2452479cef8157eae44c5a.jpg><p>Connie Britton has one son, and she chose to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;child over a&nbsp;marriage. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>, “Being a&nbsp;single mom is&nbsp;challenging, but never in&nbsp;a&nbsp;million years would that have stopped&nbsp;me. You get an&nbsp;idea in&nbsp;your head, and you’re going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. People can tell you how hard marriage is&nbsp;or&nbsp;how hard it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;birth a&nbsp;baby, but we&nbsp;do&nbsp;these things. We&nbsp;want the journey of&nbsp;that.”</p><p><h2>7. Gwyneth Paltrow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/421/354/2e46d75d0b8b766677c489d33c.jpg><p><a href=# title="Gwyneth Paltrow" data-link=tag>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> has 2&nbsp;children and is&nbsp;separated from her husband, but her love for her children has not wavered. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>, “I&nbsp;have 2&nbsp;beautiful stepchildren who are the same age as&nbsp;mine. It’s been a&nbsp;really interesting challenge for&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I love them. I’ve learned so&nbsp;much about myself through the process.”</p><p><h2>8. Denise Richards</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e68/41c/cdf2f35d4e929e505a15b866ad.jpg><p>Denise Richards is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother of&nbsp;3&nbsp;children that she handled alone for quite some time before remarrying. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>, “When you’re a&nbsp;working mom, you have to&nbsp;push yourself through. It’s a&nbsp;constant struggle to&nbsp;make sure the kids are off to&nbsp;school and fed, and deal with fights my&nbsp;older daughters have with each other over the phone. It’s like organized chaos, and it’s just a&nbsp;juggle.”</p><p><h2>9. Jean Smart</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3de/8db/7b09f858e99e5a3f98292a2839.jpg><p>Jean Smart has 2&nbsp;children and revealed that she did not anticipate losing her husband while also having a&nbsp;child. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>, “Being a&nbsp;single mother is&nbsp;the hardest thing I’ve ever done. But we&nbsp;were both actors and, you know, the work has brought me&nbsp;great satisfaction and a&nbsp;great distraction certainly from my&nbsp;grief.” She added, “To&nbsp;my&nbsp;2&nbsp;children, Forest and Connor, you are my&nbsp;life.”</p><p><h2>10. Malin Akerman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd1/50c/2a6bf15ab88df2d45d77175e26.jpg><p>Malin Akerman has one son and has been a&nbsp;single mother since her divorce from her husband. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>, “Essentially, I’ve had a&nbsp;really nice year of&nbsp;self-love, not to&nbsp;sound cheesy. Getting in&nbsp;touch with me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;son and being a&nbsp;mom and meeting new people. I’m really loving it&nbsp;and focusing on&nbsp;work and my&nbsp;son.”</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these celebrities’ stories touched you the most? Have you had any similar experiences?
