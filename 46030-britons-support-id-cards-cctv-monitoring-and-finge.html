Aside from also supporting those measures generally supported by the public, most Tory voters also back the DNA database, and they tend to support giving security services encrypted messages access (although not in the follow up question when the potential negative implications are included).</p><p>No measure is supported by a majority of Labour voters, although there is significant plurality support for requiring phone manufacturers to help unlock phones for the security services.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGt9dHyMm6mirJ%2BjwG6%2F1KmnqKqkYralecKaqZ2rXZiwtcKMpqanoaSkv6q6xmaYp5xdm7avs8Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./as-jodie-foster-turns-60-here-are-the-5-reasons-why-she-embraces-aging-with-such-elegance-809973.html><span>←</span><span>As Jodie Foster Turns 60, Here Are the 5 Reasons Why She Embraces Aging With Such Elegance</span></a>
