According to the couple, this venture combines the two things they’re most passionate about, dancing and pizza.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-recently-unveiled-their-dance-themed-business>They Recently Unveiled Their Dance Themed Business</h2><p>Dancing Pizza is now open for business with a menu named after famous professional dancers and a delivery-first policy. Although the website may feel like a scam, the dancers have clarified that their company is totally legit. Their ultimate goal is to capitalize on the demand generated by dance’s popularity, which is a great move, especially for two popular DWTS professionals.</p><p>The couple was clearly excited to announce this project, since they had been hinting at it for quite some time. Pashkov and Karagach have partnered with KitchPartner to make Dancing Pizza available via Uber Eats at select locations.</p><p>The unique menu helps Dancing Pizza stand out from other pizza places and the names make you want to try them all. The couple created the menu&nbsp;in collaboration with KDS’ culinary team and a group of dance’s most award-winning talent. All of the pizzas available are named after professional dancers including Sage Asher, GiaNina, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsay Arnold</a>, Karen and Ricardo,&nbsp;Alex Wong, and&nbsp;Elliana Walmsley.</p><p>“Dancing Pizza combines two things I’m passionate about,” Karagach said. “When you think of pizza and dancing, you always picture good times, a fun party. Pizza is my favorite go-to for my cheat meal.”</p><p>Each professional dancer name used for the Dancing Pizza menu represents a different genre of dance. Genres include ballroom, ballet, salsa, contemporary, hip-hop, jazz and broadway. Dancing Pizza is a great way to bring positive vibes and also bring profit at the same time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Karagach, Baena Open Up About Their DWTS Elimination</h2><p>Last month’s <a href=#>Prom Night</a> on Dancing With The Stars became the last time the team of Karagach and Baena would perform in the ballroom this season. Their double performance of cha cha and rumba wasn’t quite enough to keep them in the competition.</p><p>“It’s hard not to be shocked when you really put your heart out on the ballroom floor,” Baena said. “I had my best scores last night. I had my second-best scores tonight and it was like, these were my two favorite dances.”</p><p>Baena revealed he got emotional after getting eliminated and surprised to have been eliminated after receiving his best scores. Similarly, Karagach was also surprised but nonetheless proud of how they finished in the show.</p><p>“We were super surprised. In general with the scores, with the results, I feel like Joe did such a great job,” Karagach said. “I am just so freaking proud of how we finished the competition. It was super surprising, but you never know how it’s going to go in the show.”</p><p>The elimination came as a humbling experience to Baena and especially Karagach who was last season <a href=# class=broken_link>Mirror Ball champion</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LizzoAmaDress-220x165.jpg alt="Lizzo Gifts Her Award Show Dress to a Fan Who Asked on TikTok" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7y0ecOapaKdnKGubrfAq5igmZOderGt0qGYZqiRqLWsu9VmpqmdnmKubrzIs7GaZaChrqSxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./culture.html><span>←</span><span> | Wales.com</span></a>
