It’s unclear if the interviews did in fact occur.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Warriors Gaming denied in an email Friday that it had engaged in tampering. “We did not, in any way, encourage a player to tank an interview or use any proxies during the draft process,” the team said.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Under NBA 2K League rules, prior to an eligible player being drafted, the league must be notified of formal interviews between players and teams, and teams cannot disparage other teams or promise compensation beyond what is allowed for under league rules. According to the league, penalties for found tampering violations depend on the infraction and context.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">NBA 2K League Managing Director Brendan Donohue said by email Friday that last month the league had looked into allegations of tampering in the pre-draft process, “specifically regarding allegations that a number of teams attempted to influence individual draft-eligible prospects on their interview decisions,” and found “no evidence of any tampering or any improper attempt to influence draft-eligible prospects by any teams.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOoKalnJWjerTAwK2cZq%2BRp7%2Bqu9GsZKeakWJ%2FrHnTnpimZaOWtqV506hkoZmmmnq1rcypnKudlGLEqsDHZpurmZaperG%2BzqynnpukqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1609174-chinedu-ikedieze-rocks-short-skirt-whines-waist-joins-nasbois-fine-girls-challenge-nau.html><span>←</span><span>Chinedu Ikedieze Rocks Short Skirt, Whines Waist as He Joins Nasbois Fine Girls Challenge: No</span></a>
