What about the worst? Chances are you’d be able to get the point across, but you might have trouble expressing just how&nbsp;very happy&nbsp;or&nbsp;really sad&nbsp;you were on those days. There are so many ways to ask how you are feeling in English and even more answers! Do you know them all? You know that the only way to fix the problem is by expanding your English vocabulary, but which words should you learn? Here’s a list of 20 words to get you started to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">say how you feel</a>!</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other ways to say happy</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Glad</h3><p>The word&nbsp;glad&nbsp;is a simple way to say you’re <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">happy about something</a>.</p><p>“I’m glad she’s feeling better.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Delighted</h3><p>Keep in mind that&nbsp;delighted&nbsp;can be used as a polite way to say you’re happy.</p><p>“I’d be delighted to attend your party!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cheerful</h3><p>The word&nbsp;cheerful&nbsp;is mostly used to talk about someone’s personality or mood.</p><p>“He’s always so cheerful in the mornings.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Thrilled</h3><p>Thrilled&nbsp;is a word that expresses a large amount of happiness.</p><p>“My mum was thrilled to get the flowers.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ecstatic</h3><p>If want to tell someone you’re really happy, use the word&nbsp;ecstatic.</p><p>“I’m going to Disney tomorrow. I’m ecstatic!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other ways to say sad…</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Miserable</h3><p>This word is more extreme <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">than&nbsp;sad</a>. When someone is&nbsp;miserable, you can probably tell.</p><p>“Are you sick? You look miserable.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Upset</h3><p>The word&nbsp;upset&nbsp;might be used when someone is visibly distressed by something.</p><p>“His dog died. He’s really upset.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Somber</h3><p>Somber&nbsp;is most often used to talk about a mood or an object. It expresses an overall sadness.</p><p>“The mood inside the house was somber.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Gloomy</h3><p>You’ll most likely hear the word&nbsp;gloomy&nbsp;when talking about the weather, but it can also be used to express a general sadness.</p><p>“Why is she so gloomy today?”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Depressed</h3><p>The word&nbsp;depressed&nbsp;carries much more weight than the word&nbsp;sad. Keep in mind that it’s also used to refer to a very serious&nbsp;<a href=#>disorder</a>.</p><p>“He looks depressed.”</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other ways to say scared</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Afraid</h3><p>This word can be used to say that you’re full of fear or apprehension.</p><p>“I’m afraid of spiders.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Frightened</h3><p>The word&nbsp;frightened&nbsp;is most often used to talk about sudden fear, like when someone tries to scare you.</p><p>“You frightened me!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Terrified</h3><p>Terrified&nbsp;is a way to say that you’re extremely scared of something.</p><p>“I’m not going up there! I’m terrified of heights.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Creeped out</h3><p>The phrase&nbsp;creeped out&nbsp;is used to express that something makes you uneasy.</p><p>“I don’t like clowns. They creep me out.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Spooked</h3><p>This word usually means you’re startled by something.</p><p>“My cat heard a noise and got spooked.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other ways to say angry</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mad</h3><p>The word&nbsp;mad&nbsp;can mean you’re angry at someone, but it can also be used to talk about something annoying that’s making you crazy.</p><p>“That noise is driving me mad.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Furious</h3><p>Use the word&nbsp;furious&nbsp;when you want to express that you’re really angry.</p><p>“Her nasty comments made me furious!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pissed off</h3><p>Pissed off&nbsp;isn’t very polite, but it can be a satisfying way to say that you’re angry or annoyed by something.</p><p>“I’m pissed off because I just stood in line for two hours!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Heated</h3><p>The word&nbsp;heated&nbsp;might be used to express a kind of excitable anger (the kind that makes you want to scream).</p><p>“The train left right when I got there. I’m heated!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Enraged</h3><p>Enraged&nbsp;is stronger than the word&nbsp;furious. Think of this word as the angry bull in a bullfight.</p><p>“He was enraged after he lost all his money in a bet.”</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What next?</h2><p>Now you have a good base to say how you feel in English! Just learning a few more words will go a long way towards improving both your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocabulary</a> and your confidence when speaking English, but the key is practice. Try using one or two of these words in everyday conversation every week to make them a part of your&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">active vocabulary</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Cassie Wright</h2><p>Cassie Wright is a freelance writer and blogger living in the United States.
