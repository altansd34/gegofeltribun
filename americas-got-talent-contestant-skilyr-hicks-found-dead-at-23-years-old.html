She was 14 years old at the time of her audition and is known for singing an original song “Brand New Day” about her recently deceased father. She was found dead at a friend’s home in Liberty, South Carolina on Dec. 6.</strong></p><p>Skilyr’s mother, Jodi, has confirmed she does not know the homeowner. The Pickens County Sheriff’s Office shared that the singer was found inside of a bathroom on the floor and pronounced dead at the scene. Both drugs and drug paraphernalia were found in the bathroom.</p><p>Jodi also <a href=#>reported </a>that her daughter had battled with mental health issues including depression and substance abuse. Jodi has shared that Skilyr will “live on through her music.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-skilyr-s-life-after-america-s-got-talent>Skilyr’s Life After America’s Got Talent</h2><p>Even though Skilyr wasn’t on AGT for very long, she had a memorable audition. Her original songs premiered on the show were loved by fans. On the series, Skilyr shared that her music is what got her through some of the toughest times in her life. After AGT, she went on to share more original tunes <a href=#>through YouTube</a>.</p><p>In 2017, this singer was charged with domestic violence in the state of Georgia after attacking her grandmother, aunt, and sister following a night of heavy drinking. It’s been reported that her BAC level at the time was 0.126, way above the legal limit of 0.08.</p><p>She was then <a href=#>arrested</a> for underage drinking at the age of 20 in 2018. This arrested was linked to an incident that occurred earlier that month, so it is <a href=#>unclear as to why</a> she was arrested a month later. Earlier this year, Skilyr was reported missing in Greer, South Carolina after leaving her home in an <a href=#>unknown vehicle</a>, but she was found a few days later.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1357804671.jpg alt="‘Dancing with the Stars’ Olympian Suni Lee Wins Female Athlete of the Year Award" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlsBus86tZK2ZnJq7tXnCqKWtnaOprq%2FAjKyioqSpp3qptcKkqmaen6q7pXnDnpidZZGpenN%2FjLKcmqqjYrytsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./agt-winner-kodi-lee-teases-his-first-music-video-for-song-miracle.html><span>←</span><span>'AGT' Winner Kodi Lee Teases His First Music Video for Song 'Miracle'</span></a>
