In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2015&nbsp;interview, she confessed that she wants to&nbsp;remain a&nbsp;teenager forever: “I’m scared of&nbsp;the day&nbsp;I turn 19.<strong> I&nbsp;really don’t want to&nbsp;grow past 18</strong>,” Jenner then <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, expressing her fear of&nbsp;aging.</p><p>“It’s just scary to&nbsp;think how fast everything is&nbsp;rolling, and you can’t stop&nbsp;it. It’s rolling right now,” Jenner confessed.</p><p><h2>She was not thrilled with the results.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/750/95e/85e17e5b0f98e458a1340df06a.jpg><p>But it&nbsp;seems that Kylie is&nbsp;at&nbsp;least starting to&nbsp;get curious about her older self. Last week she made waves among her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TikTok</a> audience when she shared a&nbsp;<strong>candid reaction to&nbsp;the aging app</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c1c/8f7/cc197950a6868c9a11f4ac2eea.jpg><p>A&nbsp;visibly surprised Kylie shook her head in&nbsp;disbelief as&nbsp;she saw the results for the first time, candidly stating to&nbsp;the camera, “I&nbsp;don’t like&nbsp;it.” Pushing her hair back, she repeated, “<strong>I&nbsp;don’t like it&nbsp;at&nbsp;all</strong>,” visibly disappointed. With a&nbsp;smile and more head-shaking, she expressed her disapproval once again, firmly saying, “No, no.”</p><p><h2>Her fans had opposite reactions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b61/e35/b335b35125b2e28ad384eaa616.jpg><p>While some of&nbsp;Jenner’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fans</a> comforted her by&nbsp;saying she still looks gorgeous regardless of&nbsp;wrinkles and dark circles under her eyes, others roasted her and criticized her. In&nbsp;response to&nbsp;her saying she didn’t like how she looked older, one person wrote, “You can afford to&nbsp;fix&nbsp;it, so, you’ll be&nbsp;okay.”</p><p>Another commenter remarked, “Babe, you and&nbsp;I both know <strong>you won’t be&nbsp;aging naturally</strong>,” and someone noted, “You had fixed it&nbsp;before, and you can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again.”</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world fixated on&nbsp;youth and beauty, embracing the natural process of&nbsp;aging can be&nbsp;challenging for many women. However, those who choose to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;continuously inspire and amaze&nbsp;us with their grace and confidence, proving that <a href=#>beauty knows no&nbsp;age</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLi6uMieZKOdnqOys7%2BMnJinnJmZerOxwJyroqeeYsGweceeqWannJmys3nSnqOfZZOWwrSx0maYZquknr9uu81mq6KjpKS4boSQbWhsal8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1439311-juliette-porters-biography-the-siesta-key-star.html><span>←</span><span>Juliette Porters biography: what is known about the Siesta Key star?</span></a>
