However, just 35% of MPs feel the same way.</p><p>MPs are just as likely to say they oppose such a move, at 35%. This is four times as high as the rate among the general public (9%).</p><p>MPs are also more likely to be unsure on the subject, at 31% compared to 17% of all Britons.</p><p>Britons also tend to support allowing doctors to assist in the suicide of someone suffering from a painful, incurable – but not terminal – illness, by 50% to 23%. Again, MPs are far more reluctant to see such a change, with only 16% in support compared to 51% opposed.</p><p>Methodology: YouGov completed online interviews with 100 MPs from across the House of Commons as part of our <a href=#>monthly MP Omnibus survey</a>.</p><p><strong>See the public results <a href=#>here</a> and the MP results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZmxvY2qFbsDHq5yeZaGqrrPAxKuqZpqinsGwutJmqq6ooKS%2FtXnDqJqtp6JirrS%2FyKyrnpxdqMKq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-way-you-hold-hands-with-your-partner-reveals-a-lot-about-your-relationship-336410.html><span>←</span><span>The Way You Hold Hands With Your Partner Reveals aLot About Your Relationship</span></a>
