On&nbsp;April 15th, 1915, Titanic, the biggest ship of&nbsp;its time, completely disappeared under the ice-cold surface of&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;believe that such a&nbsp;massive and expensive creation could be&nbsp;destroyed by&nbsp;one simple iceberg, right? Well, recent findings suggest that the real cause of&nbsp;the disaster was a&nbsp;fire, not an&nbsp;iceberg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/735/695/e00d6350929cd9e867176473bc.jpeg><p>For over three decades, journalist Senan Molony has dedicated himself to&nbsp;studying the sinking of&nbsp;the Titanic. During his research, he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;significant discovery that shed new light on&nbsp;the well-known story. Molony discovered a&nbsp;massive black spot on&nbsp;the hull of&nbsp;the Titanic, which measured an&nbsp;impressive 30&nbsp;feet in&nbsp;length. He&nbsp;found it&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;an&nbsp;unpublished album of&nbsp;photographs that showcased the construction and preparation of&nbsp;the ill-fated ship’s first and final journey.</p><p>Can you believe that most probably the fire on&nbsp;the Titanic had been burning at&nbsp;extreme temperatures for three whole weeks before anyone noticed&nbsp;it? Crazy, right? Apparently, the high temperature corrupted the metal, making it&nbsp;75% weaker. That’s why the iceberg was able to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the ship. If&nbsp;not for the fire, the Titanic might have survived the crash, because the iceberg apparently hit the exact spot we&nbsp;are talking about. And this is&nbsp;only one link in&nbsp;the chain of&nbsp;incredible coincidences that brought the Titanic down.</p><p>The people in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;the Titanic knew about the fire and knew the ship shouldn’t have set sail. But they didn’t want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;bankrupt and cancel the trip, especially since there was a&nbsp;coal shortage due to&nbsp;miners being on&nbsp;strike. The trip was already sold out, and there were no&nbsp;alternatives: other ships cancelled their trips due to&nbsp;low demand. Everyone wanted to&nbsp;board the Titanic!</p><p>So&nbsp;the management bought up&nbsp;all the coal they could find, even from other ships, and set off. It&nbsp;was all about making <a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a>. To&nbsp;hide the truth, they turned the ship’s hull so&nbsp;that the marks weren’t visible from the dock and faced the sea. This way, the passengers wouldn’t see them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/12c/d30/2ccd5e59f6bef6bf7bc49fead3.jpeg><p>Here’s another sad twist in&nbsp;the Titanic’s story. Back then, there weren’t any sonar systems to&nbsp;detect danger, so&nbsp;specially trained people had to&nbsp;watch out for threats using binoculars. But the binoculars on&nbsp;the Titanic were locked away in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special compartment, and the only person with the key, Second Officer David Blair, was replaced last-minute before the ship took off. He&nbsp;forgot to&nbsp;hand the key over to&nbsp;his replacement.</p><p>This mistake wasn’t discovered until three days later when the ship was already at&nbsp;sea. If&nbsp;they had the binoculars, they might have seen the iceberg in&nbsp;time and avoided the crash. But even if&nbsp;they had the binoculars, they might not have been able to&nbsp;avoid the crash because the Titanic was going faster than it&nbsp;was supposed&nbsp;to. They were behind schedule and didn’t want to&nbsp;ruin the ship’s reputation, so&nbsp;they were going way beyond the speed limits the ship’s construction could sustain.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the biggest mistakes made on&nbsp;the Titanic was the decision to&nbsp;not include enough lifeboats. Even though the ship needed around 60&nbsp;of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;contain all the passengers, it&nbsp;was only equipped with 20. The designer, Alexander Carlisle, had initially planned for 48&nbsp;lifeboats, but this number was reduced for aesthetic purposes. Apparently, having too many lifeboats would have made the deck look too cluttered.</p><p>These 20&nbsp;boats were only able to&nbsp;hold a&nbsp;third of&nbsp;the passengers on&nbsp;board, which was not nearly enough to&nbsp;save everyone in&nbsp;the event of&nbsp;an&nbsp;emergency. What’s even more shocking is&nbsp;that this number of&nbsp;lifeboats was technically legal at&nbsp;the time. Regulations for lifeboats were based on&nbsp;the tonnage of&nbsp;the ship, not the number of&nbsp;passengers. This means that even though the Titanic was carrying thousands of&nbsp;people, it&nbsp;still met the legal requirements for lifeboat capacity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/31e/743/a1b8b95e549a49631c2d5ee230.jpeg><p>Another serious mistake made by&nbsp;the crew was the decision to&nbsp;cancel the lifeboat drill scheduled for the day of&nbsp;the disaster. Lifeboat drills were standard practice on&nbsp;ocean liners at&nbsp;the time, but for no&nbsp;apparent reason, Captain Edward John Smith chose to&nbsp;cancel&nbsp;it. This meant that passengers were not prepared for an&nbsp;emergency, and the crew was not adequately trained to&nbsp;handle the situation.</p><p>When the ship hit the iceberg, <a href=# title=chaos data-link=tag>chaos</a> ensued, and it&nbsp;took over half an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;launch the lifeboats instead of&nbsp;the usual 10&nbsp;minutes. Some folks put the blame on&nbsp;Captain Smith for the fact that the first set of&nbsp;lifeboats left partially empty. The very first lifeboat, which had seats for 65&nbsp;people, only carried 27&nbsp;passengers. There is&nbsp;an&nbsp;objective reason for this. At&nbsp;the beginning, people were reluctant to&nbsp;abandon the ship and didn’t understand the gravity of&nbsp;their situation.</p><p>n&nbsp;2012, researchers uncovered that Captain Smith failed his initial navigation exam. Although he&nbsp;eventually passed, some people wonder if&nbsp;this could have played a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the disaster. During the Titanic’s final moments, the crew attempted to&nbsp;send out distress signals to&nbsp;nearby ships, including the Californian. However, the Californian failed to&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;the flares shot into the sky, and the captain ultimately lost his job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;this negligence. However, recent research has exonerated the captain and proved his innocence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d81/7fa/7c0dfe536885b78c0b770a0892.jpeg><p>It&nbsp;turns out that light refraction, caused by&nbsp;layers of&nbsp;cold air below warmer air, created mirages that distorted the signals from the Titanic. This phenomenon had been observed by&nbsp;other ships sailing in&nbsp;the area and is&nbsp;now believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the reason why the lookouts on&nbsp;the Titanic missed the iceberg completely.</p><p>Historian Tim Maltin supports this theory and has further contributed to&nbsp;our understanding of&nbsp;this event. It’s unfortunate that the captain of&nbsp;the Californian lost his job due to&nbsp;circumstances beyond his control, but it’s better late than never that his reputation is&nbsp;cleared. Whatever the reason for Titanic’s crash was, it&nbsp;still keeps the minds of&nbsp;scientists busy to&nbsp;this day.<i> </i>But let’s see, what the buzz was all about? What made the Titanic so&nbsp;famous and unique?</p><p>The Titanic was massive, standing at&nbsp;175 feet tall and nearly 900 feet long. The ship was so&nbsp;enormous that even the officers took over two weeks to&nbsp;memorize all the decks and passageways. You could be&nbsp;walking miles along its corridors. The construction cost of&nbsp;the ship was a&nbsp;whopping $7,500,000, which would be&nbsp;equivalent to&nbsp;about $166,000,000 in&nbsp;the mid-2010s, due to&nbsp;inflation. Interestingly, the production cost of&nbsp;the Titanic movie in&nbsp;1997 was even higher at&nbsp;$200,000,000.</p><p>Building the Titanic was no&nbsp;small feat, and it&nbsp;required a&nbsp;labor force of&nbsp;3,000 men who worked six days a&nbsp;week for 26&nbsp;months. The job was difficult and dangerous, and workers had to&nbsp;complete tasks at&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;a&nbsp;twenty-story building without safety ropes. Nevertheless, they were paid a&nbsp;competitive wage of&nbsp;2&nbsp;pounds a&nbsp;week, which was considered good pay at&nbsp;the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/7f7/e99/470e9b552fb1be579a77b5ccc3.jpeg><p>The inside of&nbsp;the Titanic was inspired by&nbsp;the luxurious Ritz Hotel in&nbsp;London. The most impressive feature of&nbsp;the ship’s interior was the Grand Staircase, which extended through 7&nbsp;of&nbsp;the ship’s 10&nbsp;decks. The staircase was adorned with ornate paintings, bronze cherubs, and oak paneling.</p><p>The first-class passengers had access to&nbsp;an&nbsp;impressive array of&nbsp;facilities, including a&nbsp;heated swimming pool, Turkish bath, gym, squash court, beauty salon, and even a&nbsp;stylist to&nbsp;help them prepare for dinner. First-class passengers on&nbsp;the Titanic were pampered to&nbsp;an&nbsp;extraordinary extent. They had their own onboard newspaper, The Atlantic Daily Bulletin, and even their dogs were taken care of&nbsp;with a&nbsp;special area where they could be&nbsp;fed, walked, and trained during the voyage.</p><p>The first-class meals were a&nbsp;grand affair, with 13&nbsp;courses and a&nbsp;different wine for each course. These dinners could last up&nbsp;to&nbsp;five hours, and they were certainly something to&nbsp;look forward&nbsp;to. With such opulence and luxury on&nbsp;board, it’s not surprising that so&nbsp;many people were eager to&nbsp;take the first trip on&nbsp;the Titanic.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGqwMCnoJxlk5a9ta3Ip2SfmZmhsqV5x6KqZp2olrputc1mpZqumZyutbXOp2RxaWZmhHV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-tragic-life-of-the-shining-star-shelley-duvall-and-her-big-comeback-to-acting-816222.html><span>←</span><span>The Tragic Life of The Shining Star Shelley Duvall and Why She Had to Leave Acting Behind</span></a>
