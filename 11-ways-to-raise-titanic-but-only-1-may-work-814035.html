<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>11 Ways to Raise Titanic but Only 1 May Work</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>April&nbsp;14, 1912</strong>. The <a href=# title=Titanic data-link=tag>Titanic</a> crashed into a&nbsp;huge iceberg and sank. Yep we’ve covered that. But what if&nbsp;this time we&nbsp;use the ice to&nbsp;bring the ship to&nbsp;the surface? This requires several thousand feet of&nbsp;wire mesh and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;liquid nitrogen. Our goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;put the Titanic in&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge block of&nbsp;ice that will raise the ship to&nbsp;the surface.</p><p>To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, you need to&nbsp;wrap the wreck in&nbsp;the wire mesh and cover it&nbsp;with liquid nitrogen. The first problem you face is&nbsp;the inability to&nbsp;wrap the ship completely. You need to&nbsp;somehow lift the ship a&nbsp;little to&nbsp;put the mesh under&nbsp;it. Let’s say that by&nbsp;some miracle you manage to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Next, you need to&nbsp;transport hundreds of&nbsp;large tanks of&nbsp;liquid nitrogen. You’re underwater, opening the tanks and... it’s so&nbsp;cold that the icy water of&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean looks like it’s boiling. The nitrogen just sizzles, dissipates, and certainly doesn’t create a&nbsp;block of&nbsp;ice around the mesh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ecb/473/f81b9259a3b4bb898800c0193a.png><p>New attempt: raise the Titanic with the help of&nbsp;huge magnets. For this, you’ll need a&nbsp;large cruiser and some powerful magnets. You attach thick cables to&nbsp;the magnets and lower them to&nbsp;the bottom. Bright projectors illuminate the black ocean depths.</p><p>Parts of&nbsp;the wreck are visible. The magnets descend lower and cling to&nbsp;the iron hull of&nbsp;the ship. The cruiser pulls the cables and magnets&nbsp;up. Some of&nbsp;them detach from the Titanic, as&nbsp;the iron surface is&nbsp;covered with reefs and corals.</p><p>Some parts of&nbsp;the wreck break away from the ship and rise. The power of&nbsp;the cruiser is&nbsp;not enough, one of&nbsp;the cables is&nbsp;torn. Not only the weight of&nbsp;the individual parts of&nbsp;the Titanic, but also the colossal water pressure interferes with the operation. The sunken ship can’t be&nbsp;raised completely, only its small parts.</p><p>In&nbsp;reality, there has already been an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;raise the Titanic in&nbsp;parts. The $5&nbsp;million operation failed. Nylon slings were attached to&nbsp;a&nbsp;large part of&nbsp;the wreck. The other ends of&nbsp;the slings were connected to&nbsp;the diesel engines. For the entire operation, they used a&nbsp;mini-submarine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3f7/17b/dee830563095c686d0ecae6bfa.png><p>A&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;the Titanic weighing 21&nbsp;tons was pulled&nbsp;up, but one of&nbsp;the slings broke because of&nbsp;the strong water pressure. Then, one by&nbsp;one, the other cables began to&nbsp;snap, and a&nbsp;huge piece fell back to&nbsp;the seafloor. By&nbsp;this time, all the participants of&nbsp;the rescue operation had run out of&nbsp;food supplies, and it&nbsp;was far from the nearest shore, so&nbsp;they decided not to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;second attempt.</p><p>A&nbsp;book was written, and a&nbsp;movie was made about how the Titanic was lifted with compressed air. In&nbsp;reality, no&nbsp;one even attempted this operation. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, you’d need several hundred large cylinders of&nbsp;compressed air. At&nbsp;first, you install them inside the Titanic’s hull and wait for them to&nbsp;pull the ship to&nbsp;the surface.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/78c/bc6/cad72c54749018bb0f3b23cd12.png><p>As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you lower the cylinders under the water, they immediately float upwards. This greatly complicates the operation. You need to&nbsp;fasten the cylinders with cables and pull them down to&nbsp;the bottom using a&nbsp;powerful submarine, or&nbsp;better yet, several of&nbsp;them. Because of&nbsp;the high pressure, the cylinders might burst. In&nbsp;this case, the blast wave would hit other cylinders and provoke a&nbsp;catastrophe. Too expensive and unsafe.</p><p>The most expensive and complex plan to&nbsp;raise the Titanic is&nbsp;probably the one where scientists somehow extract hydrogen and <a href=# title=oxygen data-link=tag>oxygen</a> from the ocean water. Then, these extracted elements must fill special containers. Those containers are attached to&nbsp;the ship and the Titanic would rise to&nbsp;the surface.</p><p>Even if&nbsp;you extract oxygen and hydrogen from millions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;water, the rest of&nbsp;the ocean water will replace&nbsp;it. A&nbsp;machine that will be&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;such filtering should cost billions of&nbsp;dollars. Or&nbsp;you can come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;chemical element that will use a&nbsp;chain reaction to&nbsp;purify all the water. In&nbsp;this case, the entire World Ocean will be&nbsp;left without vital oxygen.</p><p>Someone once suggested blowing up&nbsp;the Titanic. You’ll need to&nbsp;lower several boxes of&nbsp;dynamite to&nbsp;the ocean floor. The boxes must be&nbsp;completely sealed to&nbsp;prevent the dynamite from getting wet. Next, you need to&nbsp;run several miles of&nbsp;wire conducting an&nbsp;electric current to&nbsp;them. Once all this is&nbsp;done, you sail to&nbsp;a&nbsp;safe distance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9df/d0b/1c5ab95f29bab56156ed677449.png><p>Now, you’re going to&nbsp;press the button to&nbsp;pass the current through the wire and activate the dynamite.&nbsp;3, 2, 1... stop. Why would you do&nbsp;this? Even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;works, the wreckage of&nbsp;the Titanic will be&nbsp;scattered in&nbsp;all directions on&nbsp;the seabed. It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;lift the Titanic from the ocean.</p><p>Imagine a&nbsp;huge hook that can fetch the Titanic and lift it&nbsp;from the bottom like a&nbsp;fish. This hook must be&nbsp;huge to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;a&nbsp;sunken ship. Let’s say you created&nbsp;it. Next, you’re on&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge cruiser sailing up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the crash site and lowering the hook down like an&nbsp;anchor. It&nbsp;falls right on&nbsp;the Titanic, but doesn’t cling to&nbsp;it.</p><p>You need special equipment to&nbsp;attach a&nbsp;bus-sized hook to&nbsp;the Titanic. It&nbsp;would include a&nbsp;huge submarine with mechanical arms. To&nbsp;build such a&nbsp;device and make it&nbsp;work under enormous pressure is&nbsp;already next to&nbsp;impossible. But let’s say, you finally manage to&nbsp;hook the Titanic. It’s then you realize the cruiser doesn’t have enough power to&nbsp;lift the ship weighing more than 50&nbsp;tons and the hook that adds about 10&nbsp;tons more. To&nbsp;complete your task, you’ll need a&nbsp;few more cruisers and a&nbsp;few extra million dollars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/468/df3/260dcb50ff87b340924c271cf9.png><p>Hmm. Once hot wax cools, it&nbsp;hardens and floats on&nbsp;the water surface. What if&nbsp;we&nbsp;deliver it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the ocean floor and pour it&nbsp;inside the Titanic? This may work, given that wax is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;expensive material. So, you melt the wax, pour it&nbsp;into strong tanks, and pull them to&nbsp;the bottom with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;submarine. The tanks can withstand enormous pressure, and the submarine has enough power to&nbsp;lower the wax to&nbsp;such a&nbsp;depth.</p><p>The containers are placed inside the Titanic. Through the remote control, you open the containers, but the wax doesn’t pour out. The deeper you&nbsp;go, the colder the water gets. While you were delivering the containers to&nbsp;the ship, the wax was cooling down and getting solid inside. Several containers are pressed against the top of&nbsp;the ship, but it’s not enough to&nbsp;lift the Titanic. Other containers simply float away to&nbsp;the surface.</p><p>And even if&nbsp;the containers were thermostatic and kept hot inside all the time, once released, the wax would solidify in&nbsp;an&nbsp;instant. There’d just be&nbsp;no&nbsp;time for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;spread and cover the Titanic from within, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;would just float up&nbsp;as&nbsp;well. You fill several large and sturdy bags with vaseline.</p><p>This substance acts just like wax in&nbsp;the cold: it&nbsp;gets solid and floats. You want to&nbsp;put bags all over the Titanic and just wait for the vaseline to&nbsp;bring it&nbsp;up. You load the bags into the submarine and descend to&nbsp;the seafloor. Some parts of&nbsp;the ship can’t be&nbsp;reached because of&nbsp;the clinging corals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1c9/0ba/c09fa4523e8af93066578670ff.png><p>You decide to&nbsp;unload all the bags in&nbsp;one place. But, as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you take the vaseline out of&nbsp;the submarine, the bags tear due to&nbsp;the strong pressure. Solid pieces of&nbsp;vaseline float&nbsp;up, pushed by&nbsp;the water. Mission failed.</p><p>The craziest idea is&nbsp;to&nbsp;fill the Titanic with millions of&nbsp;Ping-Pong balls. Small plastic balls filled with air should push the ship to&nbsp;the surface. But as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you start to&nbsp;lower them to&nbsp;the bottom, the plastic immediately flattens and all the air from the balls pops out. You can deliver the balls inside a&nbsp;submarine, but when you put them inside the Titanic, the pressure will crush them again.</p><p>Also, you can create balls made from strong ultralight material and fill them with air. In&nbsp;this case, you will need much more money. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you put the balls inside the ship, some of&nbsp;them will immediately slip through the holes in&nbsp;the ship, and the remaining ones won’t be&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;lift the wreck weighing more than 50&nbsp;tons from the bottom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8ba/59e/f193475083a119d485b23a7600.png><p>Well, to&nbsp;study the Titanic, you don’t need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;down to&nbsp;the ocean floor. On&nbsp;the Internet, you can find a&nbsp;detailed 3D&nbsp;map that shows the wreck site, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the ship itself on&nbsp;the seabed.</p><p>To&nbsp;get a&nbsp;realistic picture of&nbsp;the Titanic, researchers used sonar technologies and underwater robots, which took more than 10,000 pictures of&nbsp;the sunken ship. So&nbsp;what do&nbsp;you think? Leave it&nbsp;alone? Yeah, me&nbsp;too.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yedaasKxlpKR6s63IrJxmrJmprq%2B1wmaZrqxdpLutxYxqZKaZqWLEsL7KZm9qbGBognA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./11-flight-attendant-uniform-details-that-can-be-easily-adopted-in-everyday-life-809918.html><span>←</span><span>11 Flight Attendant Uniform Details That Can Be Easily Adopted in Everyday Life</span></a>
