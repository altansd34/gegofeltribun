That’s new! And we’re sure there’s plenty of new surprises where that came from in this week’s throwback 80’s Night! Three new singers will take the stage and one will move on to next week.</strong></p><p>So who is under the Doll mask? And what clues do we have about their identity? Let’s go through everything we know about the Doll!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V52CEH2Ykk</p>Preview of The Masked Singer 80’s Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 9</h2><p>When the Doll first walked out, all the judges commented on how big he was! He started his clues saying 80’s Night makes him “feel good, righto!” A swarm of bats go across the screen. Growing up, life was “surreal” and “rocky” because he was “a weirdo.” And when it came to his voice? “Fuggettaboutit!” He claims no one wanted to hear it. We see a birdcage in the shot. A toy house filled with animals is shown.</p><p>One day, he found other “misfit dolls” and they started their own crew. Two men in black walk up in bucket propeller hats. Then, the Doll proceeds to kiss one of them, leaving a red lip mark! He then dances around the room while one holds a boombox and the other plays a saxophone. They were having a good time until “the man came in” and said they were “too strange,” trying to knock them out. One of the men in black is seen holding a “MASKBILL” that read “Guys AS DOLL.” He “marched step-by-step into their playground and schooled them all!” The Doll hols up a red flag. Finally, we see a hairspray clue.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MACAW? CLUES DECODED + PREDICTION!</a></strong></p><p>After his performance, Erik Estrada brought out one last clue! It was a note pad that said “Ghostwriter” on it. The Doll explained, “While my movie career is scary, it’s my work with multi-Grammy winning artists that still blows me away.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Doll</h2><p>Robin thought this was an icon and Nicole agreed this had to be someone iconic! When it came time to guess, Robin predicted Gene Simmons. Jenny pieced together clues, throwing out rockstars like Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, and Nikki Sixx. Ken guessed it might be Donnie Wahlberg under the mask, but the crowd boo’ed him. And Jenny proved it wasn’t him because he was in the audience! Nicole thought it could be Sebastian Bach from the band Skid Row.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CALIFORNIA ROLL? CLUES DECODED + PREDICTION!</a></strong></p><p>Many fans online thought the Doll could be Billy Idol! Other popular predictions include Dee Snider, Alice Cooper, Anthony Michael Hall, John Travolta, or AJ McLean.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Doll on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Now we already know this has to be a singer and an 80’s powerhouse. But the question is which one! After looking through all the clues, we’re ready to predict that the Doll is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dee Snider from Twisted Sister!</h2><p>And here are all the clues that prove it.</p><p>When the Doll first walked out, all the judges commented on how big he was and Dee is 6’1″! The swarm of bats we see around the Doll’s clues could be a nod to Dee’s cover of “Crazy Train” on an Ozzy Osborne tribute album called “Bat Head Soup.” The house filled with animals is a reference to the “We’re Not Gonna Take It” music video, which was inspired by the movie.</p><p>“Starting his own crew” definitely makes sense because Dee was in a band called Twisted Sister. The “TRY ME” button around that also checks out, because the band existed for four years before adding Dee Snider as the lead singer. The red lipstick kiss is alluding to his trademark “metal-inspired drag” persona which consisted of long hair, eye shadow and bright red lipstick. When he talks about “the man” trying to “knock them out,” that is in reference to a Senate hearing instigated by the Parents Music Resource Center which Dee was involved in. That hearing eventually lead to the “Parental Advisory: Explicit Content” labels on albums.</p><p>The fake Playbill is another clue, because Dee has an album of musical covers called “Dee Does Broadway.” The hairspray clue isn’t a nod to the musical though, as it is pointing to a radio show he has hosted called “House of Hair.” Finally, the last two explanations are around the “Ghostwriter” clue from Erik Estrada. The Doll mentioned a “scary movie career” and Dee wrote a horror film called Strangeland. He also wrote a a Christmas song for Celine Dion called “The Magic of Christmas Day,” which fills in him mentioning that he’s worked with “multi-Grammy winning artists.”</p><p>Do you agree that the Doll is Dee Snider or are there any clues we missed?
