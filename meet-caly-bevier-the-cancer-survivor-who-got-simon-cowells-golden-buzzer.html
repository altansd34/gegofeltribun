Within seconds of her performance of “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten, the audience gave her a standing ovation. That same number melted Cowell’s heart and prompted him to press his only Golden Buzzer.</p><p>“Just your spirit, the choice of song, your voice, I think you’re really special,” the music mogul said. “I’ve just got this really incredible feeling about you.”</p><p>Before she sang in front of the crowd, judge Howie Mandel particularly noticed her hair, comparing it to Audrey Hepburn. This provoked her to tell her survivor story in national television. At the young age of 15, Bevier was diagnosed with dysgerminoma, a form of Ovarian Cancer. With that, she had to get a 5-pound tumor removed and undergo 21 chemo infusions to fight for her life. After enduring all these treatments, Bevier is now in remission.</p><p>Her inspiring performance in AGT gained people’s appreciation, thus pushing her until the Semifinals. This relatively long stint in the series motivated her to pursue her passion in music.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Released New Music, Got Married After the Show</h2><p>After AGT, she decided to move from Ohio to Los Angeles and signed with a management company. Since then, she has performed in various live events and even sang with John Legend of The Voice and T-Pain of The Masked Singer.</p><p>Bevier has also released a number of songs such as “Hate U Sometimes,” “Head Held High,” and “Already Know.” Last month, she released the official music video of her latest single, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Be Alright.”</a></p><p>For those who may not know, Bevier is openly pansexual and now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>married to a transgender man</a>. She happily announced this news in 2020 on Instagram.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-calysta-bevier-is-returning-for-agt-all-stars>Calysta Bevier is Returning for AGT All-Stars</h2><p>In present day, Bevier is gunning for a win in AGT All-Stars. She recently announced that she’ll be among the 60 talented acts that will compete in the AGT spin-off next year.</p><p>People might recognize her because of her hairstyle back in 2016. But one major change that Bevier has done throughout the years was bleaching her hair blonde and dying it in bright colors from time to time. Fans would definitely be happy to know that she can now style herself according to her own taste.</p><p>Be sure to tune into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT All-Stars</a> on January 2, 2023 to see if she will advance past the Preliminaries.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_LightBalanceKids_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Howie Mandel’s ‘AGT All-Stars’ Golden Buzzer Light Balance Kids" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWTlrm6ecGeraKdomLBqbGMnJinm5WnerTB0a%2Bgr6eiYsSpu4ygpq1lo566sLqMnKawnZyhwG6zzqWbnqZdl8K7xsSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1375769-lisa-robin-kelly-bio-what-happened-that-70s-show-star-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lisa Robin Kelly bio: What happened to That '70s Show star?</span></a>
