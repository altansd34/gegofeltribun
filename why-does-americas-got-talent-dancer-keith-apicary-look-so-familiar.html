What’s even more shocking is that this isn’t the first time he has been on our television screens. Once the dancer’s audition aired, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">social media flooded</a> with people pointing out that Keith is a persona created by actor Nathan Barnatt.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-america-s-got-talent-act-keith-apicary-is-one-of-nathan-barnatt-s-personas>‘America’s Got Talent’ Act Keith Apicary is One of Nathan <strong>Barnatt</strong>‘s Personas</h2><p>Keith was introduced to viewers as a shy video game lover who developed a passion for dancing. Nathan first created the character of Keith and debuted him on his YouTube channel. It was his energetic dance moves that made everyone smile from ear to ear during his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">audition.</a> He even threw in a little breakdancing twist at the end, earning him four yes’s from the America’s Got Talent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>judges.</a> His time on stage was way different from the juice box drinking shy guy that we were first introduced to backstage.</p><p>Like many longtime fans, you might recognize him from his small cameos in television shows like Lucifer,&nbsp;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,&nbsp;Adam Ruins Everything, and Community. He is also the star of Lady A’s 2014 music video for “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Freestyle.”</a></p><p>Nathan has appeared as a zombie in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop commercial</a> along with several other commercials for IHOP, Carl’s Jr., and Snapple. He got to star in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Pepper</a> commercial with Stan Lee. He has performed numerous skits and his notorious <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Skittles</a> parody commercials under the name Trale Lewous. After his Skittles commercials and skits went viral on YouTube, Skittles made him an official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spokesperson for the brand.</a> He eventually landed in the notorious <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Hungry Eyes”</a> M&M’s commercial and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Capital One commercial</a> with Alec Baldwin.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nathan-is-hoping-to-make-it-big-after-his-audition>Nathan is Hoping to Make it Big After His Audition</h2><p>Nathan started his career off as a struggling actor in Los Angeles. He was advised to create his own opportunities and skip out on auditioning for television pilots. He started his YouTube channel in 2006 and has been pumping out hilarious content ever since. His 420,000 subscribers enjoy his many personas and huge variety of videos including some that share his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">workout regimen.</a> Yes, Keith is secretly ripped underneath that striped sweater.</p><p>“I always play,” Nathan said in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>a 2012 interview</a> at the height of his YouTube career. “I never got that thought where a lightbulb goes off in your head and you get the desire to do normal things. Like adult things? I guess I do, because I work hard. But my work doesn’t feel like work. I feel like I’ve never actually grown up. I legitimately don’t think I can.”</p><p>After his America’s Got Talent audition aired on television, Nathan posted on Instagram that he is seeking an agent and a job on a show. Based on the reception he got after his audition, we’d say a Las Vegas show may be in his future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Simon-Cowell-crying.jpeg alt="Top 10 ‘America’s Got Talent’ Sob Story Memes that Will Have You Screaming" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGwZpyfmsBurcyeqaKbkah6qLvTZquapJWjwW6wwKeanqpdoLKqwMdmmKmhk5a%2FunnLqKakZaOkeqetzKKjopmiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-your-home-would-look-like-on-8-different-planets-803928.html><span>←</span><span>What Your Home Would Look Like on 8 Different Planets</span></a>
