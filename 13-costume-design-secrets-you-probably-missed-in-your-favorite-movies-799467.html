<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>13 Costume-Design Secrets You Probably Missed in Your Favorite Movies</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It’s common for people that don’t work in&nbsp;the movie industry to&nbsp;not even understand the number of&nbsp;little details that must be&nbsp;taken into account when making a&nbsp;new series or&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie. Not only do&nbsp;you need a&nbsp;good script, good actors, a&nbsp;good director, and a&nbsp;good production team, but you also need costumes, which are essential to&nbsp;telling an&nbsp;amazing story. Everything that appears on&nbsp;screen has a&nbsp;reason for being there, after all, it&nbsp;costs money to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;certain detail in&nbsp;there. Many times, costumes have certain hidden, almost secret details that have more meaning than we&nbsp;might think at&nbsp;first sight.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;raise awareness about the work of&nbsp;costume designers in&nbsp;movies and series by&nbsp;compiling a&nbsp;few details that you might have missed while watching your favorite movies, and here’s what we&nbsp;found.</p><p><h2>1. Jo&nbsp;and Laurie’s vests in&nbsp;Little Women</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d55/2ac/71a59058a0bf9a2c122e439a9e.jpg><p>Jo&nbsp;and Laurie exchange vests constantly throughout the film. In&nbsp;the director’s <a href=#>own words</a>, this symbolized that they were each other’s other half, they were meant for each other. The <a href=#>idea</a> came from costume designer Jacqueline Durran, who made several identical pieces to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;look like they share clothes.</p><p><h2>2. The color pink and Dolores Umbridge in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Order of&nbsp;the Phoenix</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd5/664/2a9e93534d832390faf422c87a.jpg><p>A&nbsp;very curious detail, and one that may have gone unnoticed by&nbsp;many, is&nbsp;that in&nbsp;<a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a> and the Order of&nbsp;the Phoenix, the <a href=#>pink</a> costumes of&nbsp;the evil Dolores Umbridge change shades as&nbsp;she gains power. The more power she has, the darker the shade of&nbsp;pink&nbsp;is. And because producers wanted pink to&nbsp;be&nbsp;related to&nbsp;Professor Umbridge only, they felt the need to&nbsp;change <a href=#>Nymphadora Tonks</a>’ hair color, which, in&nbsp;the book, is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pink and in&nbsp;the movie is&nbsp;purple.</p><p><h2>3. The colors in&nbsp;<i>Black Panther</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e0f/01e/5b28d450d4a6f2bd4380ac8351.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the scene where the 3&nbsp;main characters of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Black Panther" data-link=tag>Black Panther</a> go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the casino, they’re all wearing clothes showcasing the <a href=#>traditional colors of&nbsp;African culture</a>: Nakia, wears green, T’Challa, wears black, and Okoye sticks, as&nbsp;usual, with red. These colors can actually be&nbsp;seen throughout the whole film. It’s only when foreigners and external elements not belonging to&nbsp;Wakanda appear on&nbsp;screen that blue is&nbsp;used, for example. In&nbsp;the picture, we&nbsp;can see that there’s a&nbsp;blonde woman walking behind them. She’s clearly a&nbsp;foreigner and she is&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;blue dress.</p><p><h2>4. Chris Evans’ clothes in&nbsp;Knives Out</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/263/b47/b5ba235be9ad7aebbd5a1b6577.jpg><p>The director of&nbsp;the film suggested to&nbsp;the costume designer that Chris Evans’ character should wear expensive and brand name clothes, but that his wardrobe should look a&nbsp;little bit sloppy. The idea was to&nbsp;give the character a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;nonchalant, but debonair look. She then decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>wear holes in&nbsp;the sweaters</a> that Evans would wear and even wear out the soles of&nbsp;his shoes.</p><p><h2>5. Will’s Halloween costume in&nbsp;Stranger Things</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/252/223/fd04dc5f2ab1409dfcb7ac82ae.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene from the second episode of&nbsp;the second season, the kids are out during Halloween. The group of&nbsp;4&nbsp;friends chose to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;Ghostbusters costume. Kim Wilcox, the series costume-designer, wanted to&nbsp;make Will’s costume stand out from the other boys’ costumes. His is&nbsp;actually less perfect. You can tell that it&nbsp;was made at&nbsp;home and with fewer resources. It’s even oversized for Will. This was done on&nbsp;purpose because the production team wanted to&nbsp;<a href=#>show</a> that Will’s mother had less time and money than the rest of&nbsp;the households in&nbsp;town.</p><p><h2>6. Cobb’s kids in&nbsp;<i>Inception</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c04/d65/48f0405451843ab82d0e096317.jpg><p>Everyone who has seen Inception is&nbsp;left wondering about what the end of&nbsp;the film means. Is&nbsp;Cobb awake or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;all part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream? Well, in&nbsp;fact, Cobb finally managed to&nbsp;see his children again. It&nbsp;turns out that Jeffrey Kurland, the costume designer, might have been the one who gave&nbsp;us the key to&nbsp;understanding this. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;take a&nbsp;closer look at&nbsp;the <a href=#>children’s clothes</a> in&nbsp;Cobb’s dream and in&nbsp;the last scene, we’ll notice that they are slightly different. Also, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the movie, Cobb’s children have grown up&nbsp;and we&nbsp;can finally see their faces. Everything seems to&nbsp;indicate that Cobb has indeed woken&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>7. Ryan Reynolds’ shirt in&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;2</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca9/52b/1c88625700974b3c68591b1df5.jpg><p>The T-shirt Wade wears when he&nbsp;wakes up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the X-men’s mansion has a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;<a href=#>2&nbsp;cats</a> on&nbsp;it: Olivia and Meredith. These are the cats of&nbsp;Taylor Swift, who is&nbsp;close friends with Ryan Reynolds and his wife.</p><p><h2>8. Thanksgiving dinner outfits in&nbsp;Spider-Man</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9f/611/af4a895203bf77fff2d9ae8429.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the previous <a href=# title=Spider-Man data-link=tag>Spider-Man</a> franchise, during Thanksgiving dinner, Peter Parker is&nbsp;<a href=#>wearing</a> an&nbsp;outfit with the colors of&nbsp;the Green Goblin, while Norman Osborn wears the colors of&nbsp;the Spider-Man suit. As&nbsp;if&nbsp;this wink wasn’t enough, Harry Osborn wears all 3&nbsp;colors combined, red tie, green shirt, and blue jacket.</p><p><h2>9. Sabrina’s dress in&nbsp;The Chilling Adventures of&nbsp;Sabrina</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/276/efe/e211675a50a7b763771c8e26aa.jpg><p>The red dress Sabrina wears at&nbsp;the Academy of&nbsp;Unseen Arts is&nbsp;virtually identical to&nbsp;the dress Mia Farrow wore in&nbsp;the classic horror movie Rosemary’s Baby. This series makes constant <a href=#>references</a> to&nbsp;horror classics. We&nbsp;will also find tributes to&nbsp;The Exorcist and Nightmare on&nbsp;Elm Street.</p><p><h2>10. The butterflies in&nbsp;Mamma Mia! Here We&nbsp;Go&nbsp;Again</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/932/903/cef8215cedb22006e349103d20.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the baptism scene, Sophie wears a&nbsp;<a href=#>butterfly dress</a>. In&nbsp;the flashback where we&nbsp;see Donna as&nbsp;a&nbsp;young woman, she is&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;pendant with a&nbsp;large butterfly. This symbolizes the connection between mother and daughter and Donna’s free spirit, flying freely wherever it&nbsp;takes her.</p><p><h2>11. Boromir and Aragorn in&nbsp;The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings: The Fellowship of&nbsp;the Ring</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aac/d10/b9947d5748a6800c10b7cadfca.jpg><p>After the death of&nbsp;his companion and compatriot Boromir, Aragorn wears his <a href=#>bracers</a> and keeps them on&nbsp;throughout the whole trilogy of&nbsp;The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings. This gesture was a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;honoring his companion and keeping his memory alive in&nbsp;Aragorn’s subsequent fights.</p><p><h2>12. The tigers in&nbsp;Shazam!</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/638/974/cec63d5d9abebc34c60e364839.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Captain Marvel’s comic book, the character of&nbsp;Shazam had as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sidekick, an&nbsp;anthropomorphic tiger called <a href=#>Tawky Tawny</a> who was supposed to&nbsp;come from India to&nbsp;better integrate into social life. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>reference to&nbsp;this character</a> in&nbsp;the film, the buttons that hold the superhero’s cape have tigers embossed on&nbsp;them. Shazam also gives away a&nbsp;stuffed tiger&nbsp;— in&nbsp;Billy’s backpack there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiger and they even use the song “Eye of&nbsp;the Tiger” in&nbsp;the soundtrack.</p><p><h2>13. Klimt’s influence in&nbsp;Bram Stoker’s Dracula</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6f/d7e/fb73de539e8b18f3ea4a95a83c.jpg><p>The costume designer of&nbsp;Bram Stoker’s Dracula was <a href=#>Japanese</a>, so&nbsp;it’s hardly surprising that many costumes, and even the makeup and hairstyles, bring to&nbsp;mind the style of&nbsp;traditional Japanese <a href=#>Kabuki</a> theater. But for the final costume of&nbsp;the count, the costume designer was directly <a href=#>inspired</a> by&nbsp;Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss as&nbsp;seen above.</p><p>What strikes you the most about the costumes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie? Do&nbsp;you remember any details that seemed like a&nbsp;wink or&nbsp;a&nbsp;clue for the public to&nbsp;better understand the movie?
