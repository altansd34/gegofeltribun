Fifty-two percent said they supported the use of facial recognition technology, up from 40 percent who said the same in a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>June 2019</a> survey. Thirty percent now oppose its use, down from 36 percent in 2019.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Both polls were conducted among 2,200 U.S. adults, with a margin of error of 2 percentage points.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But when given the choice between using whatever technology is available to keep their communities safe or protecting their data privacy, 52 percent prioritized the latter, compared to 36 percent who said they preferred using any technology to enhance security.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Chicago OIG report found that between Jan. 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, ShotSpotter sent over 50,000 alerts as probable gunshots, but evidence of an actual gun crime was only found about 4,500 times. The OIG said <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>in a statement</a> the data “does not support a conclusion that ShotSpotter is an effective tool in developing evidence of gun-related crime.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">&nbsp;In an email, a ShotSpotter spokesperson defended its efforts in Chicago, noting that the city’s police department “continually describes ShotSpotter as a critical part of their operations.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The OIG report does not negatively reflect on ShotSpotter’s accuracy which has been independently audited at 97 percent based on feedback from more than 120 customers,” the spokesperson continued. “Nor does the OIG propose that ShotSpotter alerts are not indicative of actual gunfire whether or not physical evidence is recovered.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite the criticism in Chicago, public support for gunshot technology appeared relatively solid, as 60 percent said they still viewed it favorably even after learning more about it.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">&nbsp;There is evidence of support for gunshot detection technology among elected officials, including from <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>President Joe Biden</a>.
