They first met each other when they were in&nbsp;the 4th grade, and they started dating when they were 17. Anna confessed, «I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;husband, Dylan is&nbsp;the total package. He’s so&nbsp;funny, totally sweet, very smart, and of&nbsp;course attractive. My&nbsp;husband has made my&nbsp;life awesome, and he’s the person with whom&nbsp;I absolutely believed&nbsp;I would spend the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.»</p><p>Anna wrote about their friendly relationship with other people, saying, «We&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the same schools from the time we&nbsp;met, up&nbsp;until college. During that period we’ve both made our own friend circles. Dylan has always been more connected with his friends than I&nbsp;have, and due to&nbsp;this I’ve gradually become a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the group as&nbsp;well. In&nbsp;that time, I&nbsp;wasn’t invited to&nbsp;many of&nbsp;their group hangouts, but to&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;has never been a&nbsp;huge problem.»</p><p>Anna writes, «I&nbsp;didn’t make an&nbsp;issue of&nbsp;this because hey, these people are his friends, he&nbsp;doesn’t meet them nearly as&nbsp;often as&nbsp;he&nbsp;meets&nbsp;me, it’s just not my&nbsp;business.»</p><p><h2>Dylan had a&nbsp;best friend, and this person has always been enigmatic to&nbsp;Anna.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cff/ba2/71a05451bfa093aa33ba572aa5.jpg><p>Anna goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «Dylan met his best friend, Kevin, long before he&nbsp;met&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;knew almost nothing about Kevin, up&nbsp;until recently. He&nbsp;didn’t attend our wedding, and he&nbsp;didn’t attend any of&nbsp;the same schools together with&nbsp;us both, and&nbsp;I even believed he&nbsp;wasn’t friends with anyone in&nbsp;our friends’ circle. He&nbsp;didn’t visit&nbsp;us in&nbsp;our house, too, and&nbsp;I personally have met him only 3&nbsp;times. I&nbsp;thought this all was that way because of&nbsp;the peculiarity of&nbsp;his work, and Dylan once told me&nbsp;that Kevin traveled a&nbsp;lot.»</p><p>Anna revealed that her relationship with Kevin wasn’t smooth from the very start. She didn’t see him often, but when she did, strange things were happening between them. She explained, «Two years ago Dylan and&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;BBQ arranged by&nbsp;another couple in&nbsp;our group. Kevin was there. I&nbsp;didn’t even realize at&nbsp;first who he&nbsp;was, and&nbsp;I was honestly kind of&nbsp;shocked. I’d seen him in&nbsp;person only once before, but at&nbsp;that time Kevin kept a&nbsp;robust distance from&nbsp;me, which I’m realizing now was intentional. But I&nbsp;must admit that this man is&nbsp;totally handsome, he&nbsp;looks like he&nbsp;could become a&nbsp;supermodel.»</p><p>Anna revealed, «When I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;conversation with him, he&nbsp;seemed very nervous and absolutely shut me&nbsp;down after just a&nbsp;few sentences. When I&nbsp;spoke about his weird behavior to&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;our friends, they surprisingly also shut me&nbsp;down, saying that that’s just how he&nbsp;is&nbsp;and some even supposed that&nbsp;I might have said something that offended him. In&nbsp;short, no&nbsp;one even would talk to&nbsp;me&nbsp;about Kevin, at&nbsp;all. Any conversation that was about him was a&nbsp;no-go.»</p><p><h2>Anna noticed a&nbsp;strange behavior of&nbsp;her husband, too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff3/193/5c74115a9da58d6ea52f9b61dd.jpg><p>Anna revealed that she tried talking to&nbsp;Dylan about Kevin’s behavior. He&nbsp;just informed his wife that Kevin didn’t like her.</p><p>Anna said, «I&nbsp;was totally confused, because I’d hardly said or&nbsp;done anything that would have offended him so&nbsp;much. The excuse that Dylan gave was that Kevin disliked me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;relationship with another guy in&nbsp;college, when my&nbsp;relationship with Dylan was on&nbsp;pause, and this happened back in&nbsp;the college. And Dylan explained that Kevin was just too stubborn to&nbsp;let it&nbsp;go.»</p><p>Anna was absolutely puzzled about the whole situation, but she quickly forgot about&nbsp;it, up&nbsp;until one day.</p><p>She wrote, «A&nbsp;few weeks ago, my&nbsp;husband said that he&nbsp;was going fishing with one of&nbsp;his numerous cousins. That same night, I&nbsp;arranged a&nbsp;small party in&nbsp;the house, the ’girls only’ thing, and invited our mutual female friends to&nbsp;it. One girl, Lily, was sitting in&nbsp;our lobby scrolling through some social media.<br>I&nbsp;accidentally glanced over her shoulder and then saw a&nbsp;very strange photo of&nbsp;Kevin. He&nbsp;was sitting next to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot tub. This pic had been posted maybe 1&nbsp;hour before&nbsp;I saw&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;fresh one. I&nbsp;asked Lily about what was going&nbsp;on, and she just went pale. She avoided any explanations, but&nbsp;I took the phone from her and went to&nbsp;the profile that posted the strange photo.»</p><p><h2>Anna found out a&nbsp;bitter truth about her spouse and his friend.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2e/3db/cc02065fe89fa86b5acbb6a069.jpg><p>Anna goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «This profile which posted the image, it&nbsp;belonged to&nbsp;Dylan. The profile was private, and when&nbsp;I scrolled through the posts, most of&nbsp;them were his photos of&nbsp;him and Kevin together. Some pictured them hanging out alone, some included the rest of&nbsp;our friends, but of&nbsp;course without&nbsp;me. In&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the pics they seemed way too close, so&nbsp;touchy, or&nbsp;they were doing things that were too intimate for friends to&nbsp;be&nbsp;doing.<br>I&nbsp;was mortified and I&nbsp;froze. All of&nbsp;these pictures were dated to&nbsp;nights when Dylan told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;was working late, or&nbsp;just hanging out with cousins, when he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;was doing something else, and these were the hangouts&nbsp;I wasn’t invited&nbsp;to.»</p><p>Anna asked Lily to&nbsp;tell her the truth. She was looking at&nbsp;Anna so&nbsp;desperately, and she and the rest of&nbsp;their friends clearly knew what had been happening. Anna said, «Dylan and Kevin had been having an&nbsp;affair, and both were very vividly dating behind my&nbsp;back since before Dylan and&nbsp;I got married. They started dating when Dylan and&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;one-month break during college, and they were together ever since. All of&nbsp;our friends were aware of&nbsp;this, and none of&nbsp;them disclosed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;until&nbsp;I revealed it&nbsp;the hard way.»</p><p>Anna explained, «Kevin wasn’t at&nbsp;our wedding because he&nbsp;felt guilty. He&nbsp;avoided me&nbsp;so&nbsp;hard due to&nbsp;the same reason. They all had a&nbsp;group chat&nbsp;I wasn’t in. Everyone in&nbsp;the group felt totally supportive about Kevin. This man was never as&nbsp;distant as&nbsp;I thought he&nbsp;was, he&nbsp;was just being hidden from&nbsp;me. Dylan was hiding him from me&nbsp;because he&nbsp;totally hated the thought that&nbsp;I would find out they were together.»</p><p>Anna closed her letter, saying, «I&nbsp;am writing this while my&nbsp;husband isn’t at&nbsp;home. I&nbsp;just don’t know what to&nbsp;do. I&nbsp;can’t even think of&nbsp;leaving Dylan, because he’s such an&nbsp;ideal partner and an&nbsp;amazing man. But I&nbsp;also can’t stand being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;competition against Kevin, and this thought is&nbsp;killing&nbsp;me. »</p><p>And here’s the story from a&nbsp;woman, whose husband was hiding a&nbsp;very <a href=#>creepy truth</a> from her. But she was able to&nbsp;discover it&nbsp;one day, and such thing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tampon helped her in&nbsp;this detective mission.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6uK3SZp%2BinJmjtG60yKxkm52jqXqnvsiepZ1llqe8rnnMnmSiZZakwq%2BwjKisrWWnncZurc2dZKKlXaG2t7XDZm9qcGNpgHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1417149-mixed-reactions-dominican-singer-weds-beautiful-bride-ripped-denim-shorts-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mixed Reactions as Dominican Singer Weds Beautiful Bride in Ripped Denim Shorts</span></a>
