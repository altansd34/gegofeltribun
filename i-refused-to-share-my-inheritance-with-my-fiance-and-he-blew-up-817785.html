As&nbsp;of&nbsp;right now we&nbsp;have been together 5&nbsp;years, and our <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> is&nbsp;planned for May 2025.</p><p>Unfortunately, only a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks after our engagement, my&nbsp;nanna passed away. My&nbsp;nanna and grandpa worked extremely hard throughout their lives, were very successful, educated and had really high paying jobs. They were very restricted on&nbsp;spending money young and so&nbsp;lived their elderly years with lots of&nbsp;it. Worth noting my&nbsp;grandpa is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very, very intelligent man, and he’s very smart with money and investments, so&nbsp;when&nbsp;I say lots, I&nbsp;do mean lots.</p><p>My&nbsp;nanna wrote a&nbsp;hugely generous sum of&nbsp;money into her will that was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;inherited by&nbsp;me, my&nbsp;brother and my&nbsp;three cousins. Even after the money was divided&nbsp;up, there was still thousands to&nbsp;each of&nbsp;our names. I&nbsp;won’t disclose the exact amount.</p><p>When I&nbsp;heard the news, I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;fiancé, and he&nbsp;was incredibly overjoyed, much more than&nbsp;I expected him to&nbsp;be. I&nbsp;went along with it&nbsp;and shrugged it&nbsp;off until later in&nbsp;the day&nbsp;I heard him on&nbsp;the game with his mates saying, ’I can pay my&nbsp;credit card off with that money, mate! We&nbsp;can finally get that boys’ holiday we’ve been planning, ay?’ and laughing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a61/c38/a1c0e15309b7c5cc0a0aed7427.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;walked into the room and asked, ’What money?’ and he&nbsp;immediately looked at&nbsp;me&nbsp;funny and said, ’From your nan, babe.’</p><p>I&nbsp;immediately exploded on&nbsp;him and said, ’You won’t be&nbsp;paying anything off without my&nbsp;permission, and there most certainly will be&nbsp;no&nbsp;boys’ holiday. It’s not your money to&nbsp;have, it’s written to&nbsp;me&nbsp;from&nbsp;MY nanna, it’s not for you.’</p><p>We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;shouting match and&nbsp;I left the room upset, he&nbsp;later got off the game and found me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the kitchen where he&nbsp;scolded me&nbsp;again and said, ’We are getting married, you will become my&nbsp;financial BURDEN. Any money you take in&nbsp;is&nbsp;mine also. It&nbsp;was incredibly selfish of&nbsp;you to&nbsp;make such a&nbsp;fool out of&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends and giving them false hope of&nbsp;a&nbsp;holiday.’</p><p>Again, worth noting it&nbsp;wasn’t me&nbsp;who said anything about a&nbsp;holiday, and where&nbsp;I become a&nbsp;financial burden&nbsp;I don’t know considering I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very good job, and don’t want children. I&nbsp;left the house without saying a&nbsp;word and am&nbsp;typing this at&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend’s house right now.</p><p>I&nbsp;forgot to&nbsp;mention that this incident has literally just happened, the reason my&nbsp;fiancé only just found out is&nbsp;because until now even&nbsp;I didn’t know if&nbsp;the money was coming to&nbsp;me&nbsp;or&nbsp;not due to&nbsp;several <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and court complications.</p><p>Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;in&nbsp;the wrong?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e45/fec/68ca6c51fb92bd6dc61ef0713a.jpg><p>it is your money you controk it.

Not once has he&nbsp;ever asked me&nbsp;for money or&nbsp;to&nbsp;pay for something that’s for him alone. It’s always been thought of&nbsp;as&nbsp;money left to&nbsp;me&nbsp;to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;start my&nbsp;life.<br>This man who called you a&nbsp;burden isn’t worth the paper that money is&nbsp;printed&nbsp;on. How dare he&nbsp;assume that money will be&nbsp;his just because he&nbsp;exists in&nbsp;your life? The decision is&nbsp;of&nbsp;course yours, but&nbsp;I would really think about if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;the person you want to&nbsp;weather hardships with, financial or&nbsp;otherwise, for the rest of&nbsp;your life.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;OneUnderstanding3484&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>He’s a&nbsp;man child.

He’s not planning your dream wedding, your dream honeymoon, house, etc. He’s paying off his debts and taking his friends away.

Later, the woman overheard her mother-in-law making negative remarks about her.
