Now, she’s making history with the sale of the first-ever audio sex tape in the NFT cryptocurrency space. The tape called I F*cked Ryder Ripps is 24 minutes long and is being resold for an insane amount of money.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CMNF_Z7gq1K/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-azealia-banks-sells-audio-sex-tape-in-cryptocurrency-space>Azealia Banks Sells Audio Sex Tape In Cryptocurrency Space</h2><p>Banks first made the decision to sell the tape in an NFT blockchain. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to NPR,</a> NFT is a nonfungible token “meaning you can’t exchange it for another thing of equal value.” It is a unit of cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin. The tape was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first sold for $17,000</a> on the blockchain.</p><p>Basically, in simpler terms, the NFT space is a place where people can get rich fast. And the rich get richer by selling unique works. An artist going by the pseudonym Rulton Fyder made the purchase on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT marketplace Foundation.</a> He now has full ownership of the file which is one of a kind.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AZEALIA BANKS’ EXTRA MARITAL AFFAIR WITH DAVE CHAPELLE HAS TWITTER FREAKING OUT BECAUSE…</a></strong></p><p>“Upon purchase, a WAV file will be delivered to the buyer in addition to a 1 of 1 signed LP vinyl record. Full ownership, including limitless distribution and display rights are included in this sale. Don’t miss out on this historic & sexy event” the listing for the tape says.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CMNd8gjAd2i/</p></figure><p>Fans may be a little confused by the fact that the 29-year-old rapper’s former fiancé Ryder Ripps stars in the tape alongside her. Just a few days ago, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that she was dumping him</a> for being “too insecure for the wildly creative she-wolf in me.” The pair were only engaged for a week before she made this announcement. She did say she would be keeping the menorah engagement ring that he gave her.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-tape-is-being-resold-for-millions>The Tape Is Being Resold For Millions</h3><p>After selling the tape for $17,000, the tape is now being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">resold for $150,000 ETH.</a> This equates to about $275 million. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world after Bitcoin.</p><p>Azealia posted on her Instagram account about the possibility of this sale. She took matters into her own hands and edited a Wikipedia page for the highest prices paid for works of art. Should her tape sell for $275 million, she would fall underneath Paul Cézanne’s “The Card Players” which sold for $284 million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CMNQQXjgLC4/</p></figure><p>“Literally- the most expensive NFT ever. Don’t you love how We came saw and conquered this shit in a matter of 48hrs? The f*cking iconnery&nbsp;@ryder_ripps” Banks wrote on Instagram. After news broke of the tape potentially being resold for millions, Banks posted a video on Instagram surrounded by $100 bills.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CMOAYdJgDzo/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WOW!
