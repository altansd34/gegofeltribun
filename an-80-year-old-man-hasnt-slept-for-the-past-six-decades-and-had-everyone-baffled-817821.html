We&nbsp;all know how hard it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;good night’s sleep, especially when we&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;early in&nbsp;the morning to&nbsp;do&nbsp;our daily work. Well, some «lucky» people can live without sleep. This is&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;farmer named Thai Ngoc who claims to&nbsp;have gone more than 60&nbsp;years without sleep and that it&nbsp;does not affect his daily life in&nbsp;any way. Yes, this farmer certainly deserves to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Guinness World Records.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca6/8b2/59e6d356279830cc291e99863c.jpg><p>Over the years, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>this Vietnamese man</a> has been in&nbsp;the media spotlight in&nbsp;his home country, as&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;maintaining a&nbsp;healthy life is&nbsp;indisputable. Most people cannot go&nbsp;even a&nbsp;day without at&nbsp;least a&nbsp;few hours of&nbsp;sleep. However, this man who’s in&nbsp;his 80s now has claimed that he&nbsp;has spent the last sixty years without sleep and that this has not been a&nbsp;problem for his <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>, indeed he&nbsp;looks very healthy.</p><p>Since Thai Ngoc has not sought medical or&nbsp;scientific help to&nbsp;address his condition, the only people who can confirm this reality are those close to&nbsp;him. His wife, children, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances have all stated that they have never seen him sleep. «I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;the lack of&nbsp;sleep has affected my&nbsp;health or&nbsp;not, but&nbsp;I still feel fine and can do&nbsp;farming chores normally like others,» he&nbsp;told Vietnamese media outlet <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Thanh Niên News</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p>When Thai was 20&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;suffered from an&nbsp;intense fever that left serious after-effects on&nbsp;his body, one of&nbsp;them being an&nbsp;unusual inability to&nbsp;sleep. The farmer has revealed that he&nbsp;has tried various medicines, home remedies, and the most varied techniques and tricks, but to&nbsp;no&nbsp;avail.</p><p>Although in&nbsp;his youth he&nbsp;believed that his <a href=# title=insomnia data-link=tag>insomnia</a> would be&nbsp;temporary, the condition has persisted for six decades. In&nbsp;his home country, Thai Ngoc is&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;unique miracle. However, according to&nbsp;some medical sources, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;possibility that the octogenarian is&nbsp;sleeping in&nbsp;small amounts without being aware of&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/04d/092/518aea5c4f8b128d424d89d4bc.png><p>«Some people suffering from insomnia have difficulty distinguishing between being awake and being asleep, meaning the man may experience brief periods of&nbsp;sleep during the day without being aware of&nbsp;it. These power naps may be&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;keep him functioning,» explained Dr&nbsp;Vikas Wadhwa of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sleep Services Australia</a>.</p><p>The truth is&nbsp;that, even with short power naps, going 60&nbsp;years without a&nbsp;full night’s sleep seems impossible for the average person.</p><p><a href=#>Many factors</a> can lead to&nbsp;insomnia and, although its consequences are also many, <a href=#>moodiness</a> must be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most common in&nbsp;all cases.
