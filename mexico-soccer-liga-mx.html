The country has 12 confirmed cases, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, compared to 1,323 U.S. cases.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Liga MX issued a press release Wednesday on efforts being taken to fight the spread of the coronavirus in stadiums, including the suspension of handshakes between teams, the use of disinfectants on site, frequent hand-washing and the use of masks in the event of flu-like symptoms.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">With sports leagues in North America and abroad suspending operations, Liga MX, which has not announced any plans to suspend or cancel matches, could be one of the most prominent sports properties left on U.S. television as many Americans hunker down due to the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Univision Communications Inc. and its sports division, TUDN, hold the U.S. television rights to home matches for 14 of the 19 Liga MX clubs, including prominent sides like Club América, Tigres UANL, Pumas UNAM and Cruz Azul. Fox Sports holds the rights for defending champions C.F. Monterrey, Club León and Santos Laguna.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The highly popular C.D.
