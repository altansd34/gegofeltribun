During the show, Simon Cowell tried to steal his fellow judge Howie Mandel’s Golden Buzzer.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-tries-to-steal-howie-mandel-s-agt-golden-buzzer>Simon Cowell Tries to Steal Howie Mandel’s AGT Golden Buzzer</h2><p>This season, for the first time in AGT history, the judges get to hit the Golden Buzzer for one act per episode during the live shows, sending those acts straight to the Finals. On Tuesday, it was Howie Mandel’s turn to hit the Golden Buzzer.</p><p>However, Simon Cowell almost stole that Golden Buzzer after Japanese dance group AIRFOOTWORKS performed. The group seemed to defy gravity with their unique performance, which earned a standing ovation from the panel.</p><p>“I am just about to get myself fired,” Cowell said into the microphone, before moving to hit the Golden Buzzer. Mandel rushed to get to it first, and it looked like they both pressed it at the same time. Host Terry Crews stressed that it was Mandel’s Golden Buzzer.</p><p>Cowell continued trying to take credit, as he went onto the stage to celebrate with the group. Mandel once again tried to stop him. Either way, AIRFOOTWORKS is going to the Season 19 Finals.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MEET ‘AGT’ LIVE SHOW GOLDEN BUZZER AIRFOOTWORKS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-standout-acts-return-for-the-quarterfinals>Standout Acts Return for the Quarterfinals</h2><p>Tuesday’s Quarterfinals episode also featured performances from three acts who earned the Golden Buzzer for their auditions. That includes Sofia Vergara’s two chosen acts — Malambo group Legión and Japanese comedy duo Schumacher.</p><p>Legión showed off a fiery routine that included flaming knives. Vergara praised the performance, saying the group is “so, so good at what you do.” However, Cowell and Mandel expressed disappointment that the group didn’t up their game after the audition round.</p><p>Later, Schumacher performed something very similar to their audition, with improved graphics. However, the novelty might have worn off, because even Vergara was facepalming by the end of it. Meanwhile, Cowell hit his red buzzer for the act. Vergara said she stands by the duo.</p><p>Tuesday’s episode also featured another performance from Cowell’s Golden Buzzer Sky Elements, who put on an impressive drone show that depicted the judges and host as circus performers. Cowell said they topped their audition.</p><p>AGT returns on Wednesday night for the results show, as three acts will be sent to the Semifinals.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Original_StephenNedoroscik_Jamie-SquireGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="“Real Life Clark Kent” Gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik Joins Cast of ‘Dancing With The Stars’ Season 33" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZK2qmZrAbsDOZqqtnZGheqm71qKcZqWRo7GmuNJmnqiklJq7bq7Us7Geql2WwG6txq1kpaGmmnq0tM6wqmabn6PBqrrUnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shaggy-says-ne-yo-encouraged-him-to-do-the-masked-singer.html><span>←</span><span>Shaggy Says Ne-Yo Encouraged Him to Do 'The Masked Singer'</span></a>
