The brothers have been busy preparing for this momentous occasion, drawing inspiration from their recent Broadway residency and planning to incorporate new versions and medleys of some of their most iconic songs.</p><p>While some may be skeptical about the length of the show, Nick Jonas assured fans that the tempo of the earlier songs is faster, so it’s “actually not gonna be that long.” And with the Jonas Brothers’ infectious energy and passion for performing, fans can expect a show that’s both thrilling and memorable.</p><p>“Growing up in Jersey, obviously, it’s a pretty special place for us. We have a lot of memories there,” Nick Jonas explained in the interview. “But we’ve never played there, much like we had never done a Broadway thing. So, we’re just trying to check off these bucket list items.”</p><p>This upcoming performance at Yankee Stadium is the latest milestone in the Jonas Brothers’ successful career, which began in 2006 with their debut album, It’s About Time. Since then, they’ve released six studio albums, with their latest, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Album</a>, set to release on May 12.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Jonas Brothers Reveal Why They Keep Their Parenting Advice to Themselves</h2><p>As the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonas Brothers </a>continue to make headlines with their chart-topping music and electrifying performances, they’ve also been busy embracing fatherhood. But don’t expect to hear them giving each other parenting advice anytime soon.</p><p>In the same interview with SiriusXM, Kevin Jonas shared that he and his brothers have an “unspoken rule” about not offering parenting advice to each other. The three brothers are all proud fathers, with Kevin having two daughters and Joe and Nick both having two daughters each.</p><p>Nick explained that the reason behind this rule is that “the last thing you want to hear from your siblings is how to parent your child.” Instead, they respect each other’s parenting styles and simply show up as uncles for each other’s kids.</p><p>While some might find it surprising that the brothers don’t discuss parenting with each other, it’s actually a healthy decision. Parenting can be a sensitive topic, and it’s important for each parent to feel confident in their own abilities without feeling judged or criticized.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_PetaMurgatroyd_babymoon2-220x147.jpg alt="Peta Murgatroyd Stuns in Her Babymoon Bikini Pictures" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqKfo660ecGrpq2glafAbq3Np6auppOaeqa8yJxkn6GmmnqiuMGupGarlal6p7vRZrCappuasm6%2F05qboq2dYrGmrtStZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./47782-the-death-of-business-attire-just-7-of-workers-wear-a-suit-to-work.html><span>←</span><span>The death of business attire?
