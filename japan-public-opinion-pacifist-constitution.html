Likewise, although the constitution was originally authored with the explicit goal of disempowering Japan’s jingoist military leaders, few Japanese cited a lack of trust in military officials as driving their views (7%).</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The likelihood of revisions could hinge on the renewed fortunes of Kishida and the LDP</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Kishida’s rising approval ratings alongside Japan’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>suddenly surging</a> economy and positive evaluations of the prime minister’s recent foreign policy maneuvers could create an opening to pursue constitutional reform once again. But there are also strategic reasons for a near-term delay. While Japan’s current parliament already contains the necessary <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>two-thirds</a> majority of pro-revision parties to potentially table a reform motion, our data shows that only a slight majority of LDP supporters (53%) are at least somewhat in favor of constitutional revision, with just 18% strongly in favor. Public support, meanwhile, falls short of a majority among those who identify with every other Japanese political party on which we collect data, including a number of parties that together constitute the pro-reform bloc.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Given these trends, our data suggests Kishida would benefit from shoring up his political capital before pushing ahead with such efforts. While the LDP fared well in recent <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>by-elections</a>, another full parliamentary election — this time for the Diet’s more powerful lower house — is not scheduled until 2025. But Kishida’s recent foreign policy successes have increased the likelihood of, and calls for, an <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>early election</a>. With security increasingly front and center after the recent G7 meeting in Hiroshima, such an election could test public appetites for constitutional revision, or at least rekindle debate over its merits.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Shifting currents in Japanese politics could also refresh the debate</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A parliamentary realignment could further change the calculus around revision. The LDP currently rules in a coalition with junior partner Komeito, which holds an outsize share of parliamentary seats relative to its 4% national popularity, owing in part to an agreement between the two parties <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>not to compete</a> for single-seat districts. The LDP in turn benefits from outreach by the religious organization that constitutes Komeito’s base, while encouraging some supporters to vote for Komeito in nonlocal elections. Though conservative and ostensibly in favor of constitutional revision, the Bhuddist organization styles itself a “party of peace,” and has questioned the LDP’s current proposal for revising Article 9 to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>legitimize</a> the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Meanwhile, just over a third of likely Komeito voters say they support revising Article 9.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">However, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>cracks</a> have emerged between the LDP and Komeito in recent years over defense issues, and Kishida’s renewed political fortunes — and by extension, those of the LDP — could diminish Komeito’s electoral importance. The two parties’ long-standing electoral agreement has already started to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>falter</a>. Meanwhile, the star of another, more conservative pro-revision party, Ishin, has also been rising lately, further threatening Komeito’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>influence</a>. While Ishin remains in the opposition for now, its party leader says he is open to cooperating with the LDP on specific legislation. Both were recently <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>aligned</a> on their proposals for revising Article 9, about which Komeito and its adherents are more hesitant. A near majority of Ishin-aligned adults (49%) at least somewhat support revision, the next highest share after the LDP, while 22% are strongly in favor, the highest of any party. Yet even these proposals are believed to have been softened to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>appease</a> Komeito, whose leaders have questioned their necessity altogether: While 35% of Komeito voters say they are amenable to revision, a mere 7% are strongly in favor. A reinvigorated revisionist alliance and a diminished Komeito — or one left out of a future governing coalition entirely — could mean even bolder approaches to constitutional revision and military expansion, especially as Ishin starts to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>challenge the LDP</a> from the right.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Will the revisionists finally get their day?</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The idea of constitutional revision has been a stalwart of Japanese political discourse for years, yet every apparent horizon for revisionists has heretofore proved false. While a parliamentary supermajority once again favors revision, public opinion remains divided. Still, the changing geopolitical landscape, and growing concerns about China especially, appear to be normalizing the idea of augmenting Japan’s military forces, whether constitutionally or through other channels.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Kishida’s political fortunes, waning until recently, now appear to be waxing on the strength of security concerns, suggesting the timing could be fortuitous to renew public debate. And yet it remains difficult to say whether Kishida has the political capital to succeed where so many others have failed. A profitable early election could change the tide, but the bar for success, as ever, remains high.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Washington and Beijing, as well as others caught up in the gravitational field of Asia-Pacific security, will be watching the proceedings closely. Beijing would do well to take note of its role in the debate: While its aggressive posturing does not seem to be resonating with those opposed to constitutional reform, it has animated those in favor of constitutionally legitimizing an expanded Japanese military.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5%2Busa3NZqeumpyesG67z6KloqeeYr2ir8ifoKysXZi8r7%2FToquurJmkuw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./venezuela-language.html><span>←</span><span>What languages are spoken in Venezuela?</span></a>
