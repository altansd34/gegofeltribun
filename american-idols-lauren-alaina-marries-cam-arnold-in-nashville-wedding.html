Arnold described their nuptials as a “big, loud” celebration. The couple invited 450 people to the wedding, including celebs like Jason and Brittany Aldean and Shay Mooney of Dan + Shay.</p><p>Alaina joked that she wanted a small wedding and Arnold wanted a big wedding, so they “compromised.” She added of the huge guest list, “I think it’s just a reflection of how fortunate we are — we have a lot of people who love us and we love a lot of people.”</p><p>The couple apparently changed wedding planners at the last minute and put the nuptials together in just a month with Sara Fried of Fête Nashville Luxury Weddings. Alaina and Arnold wrote personalized vows for the ceremony, which was officiated by Arnold’s friend Henry Valentine Geny.</p><p>“Our siblings all stood up there with us as we got married. And Cameron’s dad was his best man, which was super sweet,” Alaina told the magazine. “It was a very emotional, very heartfelt ceremony.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>LAUREN ALAINA SCHOOLS BLAKE SHELTON IN WILD BEER PONG GAME ON ‘BARMAGEDDON’ FINALE</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-s-dogs-were-part-of-the-festivities>The Couple’s Dogs Were Part of the Festivities</h2><p>Alaina and Arnold included their two dogs in their wedding ceremony. In photos shared by People, they can be seen posing with the pups, who wore floral wreaths around their necks. The couple’s nieces and nephews were also part of the ceremony.</p><p>Alaina wore a gown from Anne Barge, which was custom designed by Shawne Jacobs, the brand’s creative director. The dress had a high neckline with lace details across the chest and arms. Her bouquet, from Forget Me Not Designs, included white roses, scabiosa, calla lilies, agonis, and anemones.</p><p>The singer walked down the aisle to an instrumental version of a song she wrote for Arnold called “Breaking Up with Single.” Their first dance as husband and wife was to “Feet Off the Ground” by Brent Cobb.</p><p>The couple will be spending their honeymoon in Hawaii, which neither of them has ever visited. Alaina shared with People that they hope to have kids “down the line a few years.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_HayleyErbert_DerekHough_The-Walt-Disney-Company-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Hayley Erbert Says She’s Making ‘So Much Progress’ in Emotional Update Video" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Lauren Alaina</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo6xlnJbCs7HNZpilmZmjrm65wKupop2jYrCiuYyaqaennJl6qrqMp5isoKaeua2xjLCcnZyZo7Rw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-idol-shares-first-full-audition-of-season-22.html><span>←</span><span>'American Idol' Shares First Full Audition of Season 22</span></a>
