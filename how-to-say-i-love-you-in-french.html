<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>How to Say I Love You in French - Lingoda</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>If you’re lucky enough to have the time to <span><strong><a href=#>learn the language of French</a></strong></span>, then you are truly learning one of the most romantic languages in the world. So it is essential that you know how to express your feelings of love to your loved one. Of course, with French there are several ways to tell someone how you feel and get lost in the romance of this language.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Saying I love you in French</strong></h2><p><span>If you would like to be straight up with no messing around, then the verb aimer (to like/love) is the one to use.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Je t’aime – I love you.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>This is the most direct way to profess your love for someone. But watch out as the verb aimer also means to like. So be careful you don’t accidentally tell a friend or an acquaintance you love them. If you want to say you like someone (rather than you love them) simply add an adverb.</span></p><ul><li><span>Je t’aime bien – I like you&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Je t’aime beaucoup – I am fond of you or I like you a lot (as a friend)</span></li></ul><h3><b>More ways to express your love in French</b></h3><p><span>If you’re feeling a little coy and would like to suss out the situation first before diving right in with “I love you”, try this one out.</span></p><ul><li><span>Tu comptes tant pour moi – You mean so much to me.</span></li></ul><p><span>Perhaps a little more vague, but it does bring you closer to expressing those three potent little words. However, if you’re feeling very romantic and would like to express your love in a beautiful, poetic way then this one might be more up your alley.</span></p><ul><li><span>Les mots ne peuvent pas décrire mon amour pour toi&nbsp; – Words can’t describe my love for you.</span></li></ul><p><span>It’s a bit of a mouthful but it will definitely get your message across. Two simpler yet equally emotive phrases for expressing your love would be the following.</span></p><ul><li><span>Je t’adore – I adore you</span></li><li><span>Je te desire – I want you&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h3><b>Terms of endearment in French</b></h3><p><span>So you now know how to say I love you. Why not spice it up with a term of endearment? The french language is extremely creative and inventive when it comes to expressing affection, love and regards for someone. Below is a selection of words you can use from regular love to animals to even food.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>mon amour – my love</span></li><li><span>mon cher/ ma chère – my dear</span></li><li><span>mon bébé – my baby&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>mon beau/ ma belle – my beautiful</span></li><li><span>mon mignon – my cutie&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>mon cœur – my heart</span></li><li><span>mon trésor – my heart</span></li><li><span>mon canard – my duck</span></li><li><span>mon chaton – my kitten</span></li><li><span>mon cochon – my pig</span></li><li><span>mon lapin – my rabbit&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>ma poule – my hen</span></li><li><span>mon poulet – my chicken&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>mon chou – my cauliflower</span></li></ul><p><span>One thing to note is that the possessive adjectives of mon and ma (meaning my) must agree with the gender of the term of endearment – not with your gender or the gender of the person you’re expressing love to. Also worth noting is that generally speaking, masculine terms of endearment can be used for both men and women, while feminine ones can only be used for women.</span></p><h3><b>How to say “to be in love” with someone&nbsp;</b></h3><p><span>This phrase is extremely particular. It means to be in love with someone and not to like someone. So be sure you know what you’re saying before you say it. Also note there is a male and female version of the word amour, depending your gender. Not the gender of the person you are in love with. Amoureux for men. Amoureuse for women.</span></p><ul><li><span>être amoureux / amoureuse de quelqu’un&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Par exemple (For example):</span></p><p><span>Il est amoureux d’elle/lui – He is in love with her/him</span></p><p><span>Sophie est amoureuse de Pierre/Céline – Sophie is in love with Peter/Céline&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Some additional words around the topic of love</b></h3><p><span>Now, you’re all set for telling someone you love them, you like them and even you’re in love with them. There are many other delightful words that are worth learning around the topic of love. Here is a wide selection for you.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>le coup de foudre -Love at first sight (Ç’est un coup de foudre = It’s love at first sight)</span></li><li><span>Moi aussi, je t’aime – I love you too</span></li><li><span>Veux tu m’épouser – Will you marry me?&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>embrasser quelqu’un – to kiss&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Sortir avec – to date (Je sors avec lui = I am dating him)</span></li><li><span>Se fiancer à (or avec) – to get engaged</span></li><li><span>Se marier avec – to get married&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>la lune de miel – the honeymoon</span></li><li><span>les fiançailles – engagement</span></li><li><span>les noces – wedding</span></li><li><span>l’anniversaire de mariage – wedding anniversary.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>le mariage – marriage&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>tomber amoureux/euse de – to fall in love with (je tombe amoureux/euse de toi = I am falling in love with you)</span></li><li><span>Comment vont tes amours? – How’s your love life?</span></li><li><span>Avec plaisir! – I’d love to!</span></li><li><span>Je ne le ferais pour rien au monde – I wouldn’t do it for love nor money</span></li><li><span>faire l’amour – to make love</span></li><li><span>fair quelque chose pour l’amour de l’art – to do something for the love of it</span></li><li><span>Entre eux, ce n’est pas le grand amour – There’s not love lost between them</span></li></ul><p>So, now you have the vocabulary, it’s time to tell your long, lost love what you really think!</p><p>If you’d like to improve your French flirting skills, look no further than Lingoda!
