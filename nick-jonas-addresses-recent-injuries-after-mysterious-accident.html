Jonas <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made headlines</a> last night after getting into an accident on the set of a new show he is filming. He was hospitalized and it was unclear what the severity of his injuries was. Jonas has finally put fans at ease tonight and detailed the injuries he sustained.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-jonas-speaks-out-about-getting-injured-on-set-of-new-show>Nick Jonas Speaks Out About Getting Injured on Set of New Show</h2><p>Daly knew that so many fans were curious about what happened to Jonas. He asked him how he has been feeling and the 28-year-old gave an honest update on his health.</p><p>“I’m feeling OK” he confessed. “I’ve been better but I’m doing alright….cracked rib from a spill on a bike and a few other bumps and bruises but I just want to go ahead and say that in case I’m not as physically enthusiastic as I usually am, Blake please don’t make me laugh as much.”</p><p>Jonas still did a great job of being his enthusiastic self despite the injury. During the first performance of the night from Victor Solomon, Jonas gave a standing ovation. He admitted that he was sweating a little bit because Team John did not come to play.</p><p>Jonas is a champion for still managing to make his appearance on The Voice tonight straight after being in the hospital. At first, it was not clear exactly what kind of show the Jonas Brothers were shooting leading up to this injury. Their hour-long show Olympic Dreams Featuring&nbsp;Jonas Brothers coming to NBC has been kept under wraps until now. It seems like this was the show set he was injured on though it has not been officially confirmed.</p><p>Each of the Jonas Brothers will be put against each other with a little help from Olympic athletes. The show is set to premiere Wednesday, July 21 at 8 PM. It is unclear how Jonas’s injury will affect the show and if his injury will be televised.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAKE SHELTON WANTS TO START A DANCE TROUPE WITH NICK JONAS</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pia-Renee-The-Voice-Burt-Bacharach-Team-John-John-Legend-.jpeg alt="‘The Voice’ Contestant Gets Special Shoutout from a Huge Music Legend" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>nick jonas</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapGWapLuiv4yam52qlajApr%2BMq5ycnZ6peqq6ya6pop2jYq6nwMSrZKaxo6mys7XOrqpmmZOYtqWxza1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nepali-powerhouse-arthur-gunn-wins-american-idol-popular-fan-poll.html><span>←</span><span>Nepali Powerhouse Arthur Gunn Wins 'American Idol' Popular Fan Poll</span></a>
