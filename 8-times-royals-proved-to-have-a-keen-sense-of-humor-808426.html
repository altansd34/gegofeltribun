It&nbsp;doesn’t matter if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;boy or&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/35a/d61/40224255e8ba07fce3df3703c4.jpg><p>Ben Cawthra / eyevine / East News</p><p><a href=# title="The Queen" data-link=tag>The Queen</a> was one of&nbsp;the many people who waited eagerly for the birth of&nbsp;Prince George, as&nbsp;<a href=# title="Kate Middleton" data-link=tag>Kate Middleton</a>’s labor took longer than usual. These situations can be&nbsp;stressful for anyone, but not the Queen. Someone asked her Majesty if&nbsp;she wanted a&nbsp;boy or&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl as&nbsp;her great-grandchild. And <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the Queen’s response left a&nbsp;smile on&nbsp;everyone’s face</a>, she said, “I&nbsp;don’t really mind. I&nbsp;hope it&nbsp;arrives soon because I’m going on&nbsp;holiday.”</p><p><h2>2. Kate cares about her husband’s looks.</h2></p><p>Going bald is&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal process among men. When the Duke and Duchess of&nbsp;Cambridge visited the Royal Easter Show in&nbsp;Australia, they were watching a&nbsp;shearing demonstration, where Kate just couldn’t keep herself from making a&nbsp;joke about her husband’s bald spots.</p><p>“The Prince was interested in&nbsp;the alpaca and as&nbsp;I showed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;them, the Princess said that he&nbsp;should put the alpaca fur on&nbsp;his head,” the local farmer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reported</a>. The princess said, “You need it&nbsp;more than&nbsp;me” and pointed to&nbsp;his head while laughing, fortunately the duke understood the joke, and they shared a&nbsp;laugh together.</p><p><h2>3. Despite her fame, even she can go&nbsp;unrecognized sometimes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f65/4bb/15773551ff9eedd53dad334877.jpg><p>PA Pool / Associated Press / East News</p><p>The Queen is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous women in&nbsp;the world, although her fame, once she reportedly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wasn’t recognized</a> by&nbsp;a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;tourists while at&nbsp;her Balmoral country home. But that’s not all, the group of&nbsp;tourists even asked her if&nbsp;she had ever met the Queen. Elisabeth jokingly pointed to&nbsp;her<br>protection officer and said, “No, but this policeman has.”</p><p><h2>4. William came clean about Kate’s cooking skills.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8cb/236/f46f2e5f599be5f38f7b49f032.jpg><p>PA / East News</p><p>It’s easy to&nbsp;tell if&nbsp;you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;close relationship with your partner, because this way you can be&nbsp;completely honest with each other. Kate once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed to&nbsp;her cooking skills</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;gala dinner where she said: “William has to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with my&nbsp;cooking most of&nbsp;the time,” to&nbsp;which William jokingly replied, “It’s the reason I’m so&nbsp;skinny!”</p><p><h2>5. Still Alive</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/04f/00b/a3b8f0585488da0a165d3b3c02.jpg><p>Pool PA / Associated Press / East News</p><p>The Queen met some people several years ago, when one of&nbsp;them nicely asked about how she was doing. Instead of&nbsp;the boring basic response, “Fine, how are you?” the Queen’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>answer was much funnier</a> than that. She said, “I’m still alive.” Ever since that encounter, she turned 95&nbsp;and is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the longest-reigning monarchs of&nbsp;all time.</p><p><h2>6. She did it&nbsp;for charity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2c/54f/4daa415d3b970ff43cca89c01f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the game of&nbsp;love toward others, there really is&nbsp;a&nbsp;competition, especially for the Duke and Duchess. Back in&nbsp;2015 during a&nbsp;holiday charity event, William spotted his wife getting a&nbsp;little too kind and flirty on&nbsp;the phone while speaking to&nbsp;a&nbsp;broker and trying to&nbsp;firm up&nbsp;a&nbsp;business transaction to&nbsp;out-earn her husband. When the Duke caught her, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;jokingly said</a>, “Catherine, I&nbsp;think you can stop flirting with them now!” in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the group, as&nbsp;Middleton giggled and playfully bantered on&nbsp;the phone.</p><p><h2>7. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;response to&nbsp;the eggs, they got something no&nbsp;one expected.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58a/43a/4a9ddf5adbad9bb2320cb450fd.jpg><p>Hans-Peter Merten / Robert Harding / East News</p><p>Once on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip in&nbsp;<a href=# title="New Zealand" data-link=tag>New Zealand</a>, some unhappy citizens <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>threw eggs at&nbsp;the Queen</a>, but she took it&nbsp;as&nbsp;calmly as&nbsp;possible, and even cracked a&nbsp;joke about it&nbsp;saying, “New Zealand has long been renowned for its dairy produce, though&nbsp;I should say that&nbsp;I myself prefer my&nbsp;New Zealand eggs for breakfast.”</p><p><h2>8. His father taught him well.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89a/c3e/1350b95f7d9eaec53e281da231.jpg><p>Royalfoto / News Pictures / East News</p><p>Once, when Prince Charles met an&nbsp;actress who wore a&nbsp;low-cut dress, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;told the actress the following</a>: “Father told me&nbsp;that if&nbsp;I ever met a&nbsp;lady in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dress like yours, I&nbsp;must look her straight in&nbsp;the eyes.”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;the Royal family’s humor? Even though they seem so&nbsp;serious, did you know that they also had a&nbsp;funny side?</p><p>Preview photo credit Royalfoto / News Pictures / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIVuwMimnKxloqTGorjSZqerp6aasW7Azmafmq6VYq5ut8SepWarlaPApnnOn2ShrZ2kv26Ej3Fra25f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1463041-70-inspirational-quotes-boost-confidence.html><span>←</span><span>70+ inspirational believe in yourself quotes to boost your confidence</span></a>
