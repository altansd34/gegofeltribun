However, both couples broke&nbsp;up, with Fältskog and Ulvaeus separating in&nbsp;1979 and Lyngstad and Andersson getting a&nbsp;divorce in&nbsp;1981. 2&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;1983, the foursome decided that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;best for them to&nbsp;disband.</p><p><strong>Fältskog and Björn also had 2&nbsp;children together</strong>, so&nbsp;the strain between them was getting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too much. However, in&nbsp;2018, 35&nbsp;years after their breakup, the band came together to&nbsp;record a&nbsp;few new songs.
