On the other hand, you probably also don’t like the idea of making basic grammar mistakes.</span></p><p><span>The truth is that English grammar is a source of constant frustration for many learners and the rules regarding <a href=#>adverbs</a> are no exception.</span></p><p><span>How do you know you’re using them correctly?</span></p><p><span>Where do they go in a sentence?</span></p><p><span>Will native speakers still understand you if you get confused and mess up?</span></p><p><span>Don’t worry. We’ve got a few tips to help you out.</span></p><h2><strong>How often?</strong></h2><p><span>You know what an</span><a href=#> <span>adverb</span></a><span> is, but what exactly is an adverb of frequency?</span></p><p><span>Basically, these kinds of adverbs are used to answer the question “</span><i><span>How often</span></i><span>?”</span></p><p><span>For example, if your teacher asks, “How often do you practise speaking English at home?” you could simply list off all the days you practised, but that could end up being a pretty long list.</span></p><p><span>An easier, and more common, way to answer is by using an adverb.</span></p><h2><strong>Using definite adverbs</strong></h2><p><span>What are definite adverbs of frequency?</span></p><p><span>Definite adverbs include words such as: daily, annually, once a week, once, twice, every day. They’re used to answer the question of “</span><i><span>How often</span></i><span>?” in a more specific way.</span></p><p><span>For example, you might answer the question, “How often do you practise speaking English at home?” by saying, “I practise <strong>every</strong> day” or “I practise <strong>twice</strong> a week.”</span></p><p><span>These are easy to use since they always go at the beginning or end of a sentence.</span></p><p><span>You can also use days of the week as definite adverbs of frequency. For example, “On <strong>Sundays</strong>, I go for a walk” or “<strong>Every</strong> Saturday, I visit my parents.”</span></p><h2><strong>Using indefinite adverbs</strong></h2><p><span>Indefinite adverbs of frequency are a little more complicated, but you’ll probably hear them used a lot.</span></p><p><span>These include words such as: always, constantly, usually, a lot, normally, frequently, regularly, often, sometimes, occasionally, infrequently, rarely, seldom, hardly ever, and never.</span></p><p><span>Where do they go in a sentence?</span></p><p><span>That’s where it gets complicated.</span></p><h3><b>Just one verb</b></h3><p><span>Indefinite adverbs of frequency usually come before the main verb, as with the sentence, “She <strong>constantly</strong> looks at her phone.”</span></p><p><span>Whenever there’s a sentence with a helping, or auxiliary, verb, the adverb goes before the main verb. For example, “He has <strong>never</strong> been late for work.”</span></p><h3><b>Except the verb </b><b><i>be</i></b></h3><p><span>The verb </span><i><span>be</span></i><span> is one exception to this rule. Adverbs usually come after the verb </span><i><span>be </span></i><span>in a sentence. For instance, “My teacher is <strong>always</strong> punctual.”</span></p><h3><b>First or last in a sentence?</b></h3><p><span>You might see an indefinite adverb at the beginning or end of a sentence, especially when it’s used for emphasis. For example, in the sentence, “<strong>Sometimes</strong>, Jane eats ice cream for dessert,” the word </span><strong><i>sometimes </i></strong><span>is emphasised by appearing at the beginning of the sentence.</span></p><p><span>Most adverbs of frequency can also go at the end of a sentence, as in, “David travels <strong>frequently</strong>.”</span></p><p><span>However, the words </span><i><span>always</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>rarely</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>seldom</span></i><span> cannot go at the end of a sentence.</span></p><h3><b>Negative sentences</b></h3><p><span>If you want to use an adverb of frequency in the negative form, simply put the adverb before main verb as usual: “She doesn’t <strong>usually</strong> cook.”</span></p><p><span>Just be sure <strong>not</strong> to use negative adverbs, such as </span><i><span>rarely</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>seldom</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>never</span></i><span>, in a negative sentence. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As with any grammar rule, keep in mind that you might come across a few exceptions. However, by following these easy guidelines, you should have no trouble learning to use adverbs with confidence. As always, the most important thing is to keep practising.&nbsp; Try a <span><strong><a href=#>Lingoda</a> </strong></span>lesson today and put the theory into practice!&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Cassie Wright</h2><p>Cassie Wright is a freelance writer and blogger living in the United States. After a bad experience with elementary school Spanish classes, she fell in love with learning French. Now, in addition to French, she spends a considerable amount of time learning Japanese and has jumped back into learning Spanish. Like many avid language learners, she plans to continue learning more languages than she has hours in the day. When she isn’t writing or learning, she loves reading, traveling, video games, and all forms of chocolate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3yisNWeqZurXaSzbrLRnqiunZ6Yxm6x16mjmqGemrFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-woman-refuses-to-shave-or-shower-because-it-is-a-waste-of-time-817827.html><span>←</span><span>A Woman Refuses to Shave or Shower Because It Is a Waste of Time</span></a>
