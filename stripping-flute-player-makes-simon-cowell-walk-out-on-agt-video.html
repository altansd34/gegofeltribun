Such was the case when flute player Brandon Coprich auditioned for AGT in 2019.</strong></p><p>The thing is, Brandon didn’t just play the flute. He also turned his act into a stripper routine a la Magic Mike. Simon was clearly not a fan, as he ended up leaving the auditorium.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4-9MRlPCVY</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-walks-out-of-stripper-act>Simon Cowell Walks Out Of Stripper Act</h2><p>Brandon walked out on stage wearing a nice suit and a bowtie. The judges informed him that AGT host Terry Crews also plays the flute. “There’s not too many of us boys playing the flute, so we gotta represent,” Brandon said.</p><p>Simon Cowell made it clear from the start that he wasn’t a flute fan. “I know that people like playing them. Does anyone like listening to them?” he wondered. Brandon assured him there was “something for everybody.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>10 TIMES ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’ FORGOT IT’S A FAMILY SHOW [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>That something turned out to be a striptease. Part of the way through the performance, “Pony” by Ginuwine started playing, and Brandon began removing his clothes. At first, Simon Cowell laughed. But it didn’t take long for him to hit his red buzzer.</p><p>Brandon then began to play his flute while dancing in his leather shorts and bowtie. That made Simon hit fellow judge Julianne Hough’s buzzer. When Brandon started using his flute like a stripper pole, Howie Mandel hit his own buzzer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-terry-crews-joins-in-on-the-sexy-flute-routine>Terry Crews Joins In On The Sexy Flute Routine</h3><p>Eventually, Simon walked over to Gabrielle Union and hit her buzzer, ending Brandon’s performance. This led to boos from the audience. “I’m gonna say no. You can do it again for them. Goodbye,” Simon said before getting up and walking away from the table.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>DAVID WALLIAMS TEAMS UP WITH SEXY DANCER TO GIVE DAVID WALLIAMS A LAP DANCE [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>That’s when Terry Crews walked out on stage, wearing no shirt and holding a flute of his own. He and Brandon started performing together, prompting Simon to fully exit the auditorium.</p><p>Sadly, Brandon didn’t make it to the next round.
