Some viewers believe that if the at-home audience had been able to vote, the results would have been much different.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-you-think-you-can-dance-elimination-angers-fans>So You Think You Can Dance Elimination Angers Fans</h2><p>During Wednesday night’s show, the dancers were paired up with new partners. Jordan Betscher was paired with Beau Harmon for the Viennese Waltz. However, during rehearsals, Jordan was sick and had to take time away.</p><p>Beau ended up rehearsing with Koine Iwasaki, who competed in Season 14. Jordan eventually rejoined Beau to prepare for the dance. They only had three hours to rehearse together, but you’d never know it from their graceful performance.</p><p>Despite her impressive showing, Jordan was in the bottom four and ended up being eliminated, along with Thiago Pacheco. This <a href=#>angered fans</a> on Twitter, who thought Jordan’s performance earned her a spot in the next round.</p><p>Some fans pointed to this season’s new format, in which the in-studio audience and judges decide who should move on rather than the audience at home. One Twitter user wrote that if viewers had been able to vote, “these results would be so different.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE’ ANGERS FANS BY REMOVING AT-HOME VOTING</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Had america been able too vote… these results would be so different <a href=#>#SYTYCD</a></p>— Emily Elizabeth (@EmElizabeth928) <a href=#>June 30, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#sytycd</a> how are the two female dancers with the best technique in the bottom???

In addition to the new voting format, the judging panel has also had a shake-up. The show introduced three new judges this season — JoJo Siwa, Stephen “tWitch” Boss, and Matthew Morrison.</p><p>After filming four episodes, Morrison left the show due to not following production protocols. He later admitted that he <a href=#>sent a direct message</a> to a contestant on the show, although he denied reports that it was fliratious. Morrison was replaced by <a href=#>new judge Leah Remini</a>.</p><p>Siwa has also faced some negativity from fans for her role on the judging panel. She recently <a href=#>defended her credentials</a>, saying, “Am I the smartest dancer in the world? By no means. Am I the most knowledgeable dancer in the world? By no means. But I am smart enough to be a judge on&nbsp;So You Think You Can Dance, absolutely.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Original_BlakeShelton_KevinWinterGettyImagesforBudLight.jpg alt="Blake Shelton Performs Old Song He Regrets Not Making a Single" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>so you think you can dance</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qhksqelYsGptc2kZLKnpWKworqMnZinm5Vis6K60mamrqyilrSmsIyorZ6qXaGutbHSrWSepJmitq%2Bt06Kmp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwts-pro-witney-carson-launches-skincare-brand-active-earth-organics.html><span>←</span><span>'DWTS' Pro Witney Carson Launches Skincare Brand, Active Earth Organics</span></a>
