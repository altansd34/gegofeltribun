He shared a rehearsal video that put that question to rest.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-todrick-hall-responds-to-masked-singer-lip-syncing-question>Todrick Hall Responds to ‘Masked Singer’ Lip Syncing Question</h2><p>Since it’s not really necessary for people wearing giant masks to lip sync, we assume fans have been wondering whether the celebrities on The Masked Singer perform to pre-recorded songs, or if they sing live. The answer is that they sing live.</p><p>“For anyone who asks if we lipsync on&nbsp;@maskedsingerfox&nbsp;here is your answer lol,” Hall wrote to accompany a brief rehearsal video. In the clip, he can be seen practicing his performance of <a href=#>“Straight Up” by Paula Abdul</a>. The routine involved falling backwards off a platform to be caught by the dancers.</p><p>In the clip, Hall practices the move while singing. When he falls back, you can hear a slight wobble in his voice. As Hall wrote, “Timing how to fall mid sentence to avoid millions of people hearing this was a STRUGGLE, but I figured it out though!”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>TODRICK HALL CONVINCED ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ TO GIVE HIM HIS BULL COSTUME</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CYPs7R7oweb/?utm_medium=copy_link</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-show-s-masks-are-designed-for-contestants-to-sound-good>The Show’s Masks Are Designed for Contestants to Sound Good</h3><p>Fans aren’t the only ones who thought the performances might be pre-recorded. As Season 3 winner Kandi Burgess (aka Night Angel) said in <a href=#>an interview</a>, “In my mind I was thinking it’s gonna be fine, like they’re pre-taping or something like that. But then when I got there and they were like, ‘oh no, you’ve got to really sing’ I was a little nervous.”</p><p>Back when the show first premiered, executive producer Craig Plestis answered a similar question about the contestants singing live. As he told <a href=#>TV Line</a>, “The great thing about the show is that everyone had to sing live and they only had one take each.”</p><p>Plestis added that “it was really difficult designing the masks and getting that great audio level.” The singer’s costumes are <a href=# class=broken_link>designed by Marina Toybina</a>, who won an Emmy for her work on the show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/The-Voice-Pete-Mroz.jpg alt="Team Blake Reunites for a Concert at Shelton’s Ole Red Doghouse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>todrick hall</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706ibq6GToHqprculZKudo6W8r7DSZquoZaCavLG4xGaYrKOZo7RutcVmn55lnJ69br%2FYp5qenF2ku27Ax55kppmjoLKledKipaCdomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-jonas-brothers-announce-epic-five-album-set-for-yankee-stadium-debut.html><span>←</span><span>The Jonas Brothers Announce Epic Five-Album Set for Yankee Stadium Debut</span></a>
