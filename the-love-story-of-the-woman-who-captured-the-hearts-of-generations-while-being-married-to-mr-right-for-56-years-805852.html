But there are a&nbsp;few sweethearts who seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;live up&nbsp;to&nbsp;their reputations, and their fans seem to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;grow year after year.</p><p><h2>Her road to&nbsp;success: where there’s a&nbsp;will, there’s a&nbsp;way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f5/df5/dc08cd58189a259f4671880f49.jpg><p>Dolly’s family was anything but rich and they had 12&nbsp;children. To&nbsp;give you an&nbsp;example, the doctor who delivered her was paid with a&nbsp;sack of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cornmeal</a> instead of&nbsp;money. But she always dreamed big, her first audience was farm animals to&nbsp;whom she sang songs, imagining how she would be&nbsp;singing to&nbsp;real fans.</p><p>Her family noticed how serious she was about <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a>, so&nbsp;her uncle taught her how to&nbsp;play the guitar and took her to&nbsp;different places to&nbsp;sing. With such dedication and trust in&nbsp;herself, Dolly was on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TV</a> before she owned one.</p><p>While working hard to&nbsp;climb the ladder of&nbsp;fame step by&nbsp;step, a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention was drawn to&nbsp;her style, which is&nbsp;often associated with daring clothes. Drawn to&nbsp;bright colors, sparkles, and sky-high hair, she herself <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>joked</a> that it&nbsp;costs a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money to&nbsp;look this cheap.</p><p><h2>Behind her sparkling style, there’s a&nbsp;very genuine personality.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b8/47a/bd09e758ff8943c97960e67dba.jpg><p>AF Archive/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News<span>, </span>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>Don’t be&nbsp;distracted by&nbsp;her glamorous look, there’s a&nbsp;very sweet people-person hiding behind&nbsp;it. As&nbsp;she wrote in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>songs </a><i>“I’m just a&nbsp;Backwoods Barbie in&nbsp;a&nbsp;push-up bra and heels. I&nbsp;might look artificial, but where it&nbsp;counts I’m real.”</i></p><p>She genuinely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loves</a> people, and they feel&nbsp;it. One man who couldn’t help but fall in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> with her became her life-long <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>love</a>. She was just 18&nbsp;at the time they met, and last year they celebrated 58&nbsp;years of&nbsp;being together. They seem to&nbsp;have such different personalities, and yet almost every aspect of&nbsp;Dolly and Carl’s character compliments the other.</p><p><h2>Her secret to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lifelong marriage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/02f/208/85cf2b599184d7d65784f096fb.jpg><p>“Find you a&nbsp;partner who will support you like my&nbsp;Carl Dean does!” she wrote on&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> page. They’ve loved and cared for each other without forgetting the importance of&nbsp;each other’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>independence</a>. While her partner prefers to&nbsp;stay out of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spotlight</a>, they both enjoy spending time together and just being simple, being themselves.</p><p><h2>She tries to&nbsp;bring a&nbsp;positive change into the world.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c20/8a2/9c93425bafb3ba99bbf67a67f0.jpg><p>Dolly uses the power she has over people to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;positive change. For example, the Dollywood foundation came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;start to&nbsp;improve the lives of&nbsp;young people with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;buddy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>program</a>. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;this, Dolly offered to&nbsp;personally pay every student who graduated from high school if&nbsp;both the student and their buddy graduated. The dropout rate plummeted from&nbsp;30% to&nbsp;6%.</p><p>Lately, her amusement park was called one of&nbsp;the best midsize <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>employers</a> in&nbsp;the US. No&nbsp;wonder she was on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;the 100 of&nbsp;the most influential people of&nbsp;2021 by&nbsp;Forbes. On&nbsp;this occasion, a&nbsp;sweet tribute was written by&nbsp;her goddaughter <a href=# title="Miley Cyrus" data-link=tag>Miley Cyrus</a>, where Miley reminded&nbsp;us that Dolly’s reputation isn’t based on&nbsp;wigs and silicone, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>guides</a> people, and she does it&nbsp;with pride.</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in February 2023 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYylpq%2BdXajBsL7YZqafZaSdsm7DzqaYp2Wnnbxur8Cpq66qlZl6tbTEZp%2BemaKpwG67xWaenqaVp661tc6nqmavmJ65pnnBnqCnn12irrO%2ByJ6bZqyfYrqzedGinqGsXZu8s3mUb2SynZGnwG6Ej25vbmpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1421623-sophie-flays-biography-bobby-flays-daughter-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sophie Flays biography: what is known about Bobby Flays daughter?</span></a>
