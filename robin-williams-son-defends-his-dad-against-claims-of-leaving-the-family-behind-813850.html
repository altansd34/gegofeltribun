The actor battled mental health issues for years, and sadly, it&nbsp;was these struggles that ultimately led to&nbsp;his passing.</p><p>Despite facing personal challenges, Robin Williams remained a&nbsp;loving family man who deeply cared for his wife, Susan Schneider, and his three children, Zelda, Cody, and Zak. His affection for his family was evident, and he&nbsp;cherished his role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;husband and father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6bb/c38/af99485298a1fc9df0355c14dc.jpg><p>0000001/Reporter/ East News</p><p>Robin Williams had his first son, Zachary, from his previous marriage to&nbsp;Valeria Velardi. He&nbsp;later had two more children, Zelda and Cody, with his second wife. Despite his busy career and worldwide fame, Robin always prioritized his relationship with his kids and made an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for them.</p><p>Robin Williams acknowledged that being a&nbsp;father came with its challenges, and he&nbsp;openly admitted his shortcomings in&nbsp;that role. “I’m so&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;them in&nbsp;different ways, but have they always been cherubs? No, but that’s been part of&nbsp;the process,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “And am&nbsp;I the ‘world’s greatest dad?’ Not at&nbsp;all, I’m a&nbsp;work-in-progress, but&nbsp;I love them.”</p><p><h2>Zak paid a&nbsp;touching tribute, but also faced accusations about his late father.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/035/c8a/5e43b85a5fb0b74e7e5c8d77ac.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2014</a>, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;63, Williams passed away. According to&nbsp;Zak, his father experienced feelings of&nbsp;“frustration” upon receiving the Parkinson’s disease diagnosis, and he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;support him throughout the whole journey. “I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for him on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis. I&nbsp;really wanted to&nbsp;because it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;really isolating, even if&nbsp;you’re with family and loved ones,” Zak <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>.</p><p>Recently, Robin’s eldest son paid tribute on&nbsp;Father’s Day by&nbsp;sharing a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>picture</a> with a&nbsp;caption: “Dad, I’m specifically remembering you for your <a href=# title=courage data-link=tag>courage</a> and compassion today. Thank you for helping me&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kind to&nbsp;myself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;first step toward showing up&nbsp;for others.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/73e/fbe/224253554dac06959cb0e46a9b.jpg><p>CJ Contino/Everett Collection Minimum/ EAST NEWS</p><p>Even though the tribute was filled with love, Zak had to&nbsp;deal with some accusations. While most fans reacted positively to&nbsp;the heartfelt tribute, one person claimed the actor “had left his family behind” when he&nbsp;passed away.</p><p>Zak responded with no&nbsp;hard feelings. Instead, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> how challenging it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;lose someone dear and emphasized how his father had been a&nbsp;caring parent to&nbsp;his kids.</p><p>“First, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;acknowledge your perspective. With that said, there was a&nbsp;time when&nbsp;I was resentful, and I’ve done what&nbsp;I believe is&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;work through the stigma associated with what you are referencing.” He&nbsp;then wrote, “No&nbsp;one is&nbsp;asking you to&nbsp;idolize my&nbsp;father. I&nbsp;adored him as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was an&nbsp;incredible friend and parent, and I’m sharing what I&nbsp;am remembering him for today.”</p><p><h2>Robin will always remain a&nbsp;courageous man to&nbsp;his family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/35d/906/9576e7586783c5452ce26e17c8.jpg><p>Even during his most challenging times, Robin’s devotion to&nbsp;his family never wavered, leaving an&nbsp;enduring legacy of&nbsp;courage and compassion. Even though his children and wife are still grieving over him, the thought is&nbsp;still vivid and steady. “There’s not a&nbsp;day that goes by&nbsp;that we&nbsp;don’t think about our dad,” his son declared.</p><p>“I&nbsp;miss him all the time,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “Often I&nbsp;see something, or&nbsp;if&nbsp;I’m watching a&nbsp;film, I&nbsp;think, ’Oh, man, he&nbsp;would have appreciated this’ or, ’He would have gotten a&nbsp;laugh out of&nbsp;this.’ ”</p><p>The greatness of&nbsp;artists like Robin Williams is&nbsp;so&nbsp;immense that nothing can overshadow their memory. Robin Williams, with his pure <a href=#>soul</a>, will always be&nbsp;remembered for who he&nbsp;was, not how he&nbsp;left&nbsp;us. This shows that when a&nbsp;celebrity is&nbsp;truly remarkable, their human side will always be&nbsp;cherished.</p><p>Preview photo credit 0000584/Reporter/East News<span>, </span>0000001/Reporter/ East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL%2BwrsinZLChnKG2ornSZqqopl2ZsqexzZ2qZqCZqHqlrcNmmKCZmaPAtXnCpZiipaNivKd5y56Yr6GenHq1tMRmnZqlmaHGbq7EoaCnnF1tfnSElGlm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1319173-radek-vitek-16-year-goalkeeper-joins-premier-league-side-man-united.html><span>←</span><span>Radek Vitek, 16-year-old goalkeeper, joins Premier League side Man United</span></a>
