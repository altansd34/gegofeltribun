In the gaming community, he is one of the most popular Fortnite streamers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8f894f110ecde005.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover exciting facts about the famous gamer Tfue</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tyler is a professional gamer and YouTube star. He has over 22 million subscribers on his channel, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">thousands of fans</a> watch his videos.

However, just two months later, in early 2019, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the title had shifted</a> to a tie among Ninja, Mongraal, Vivid, 72hrs and MrSavageM.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d503b6375ea72b73.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 richest footballers in Africa</span></p></a><h2>Who is the highest paid Fortnite streamer?</h2><p class=align-left>The question of 'How much do Fortnite streamers make' has been a fascinating query since the game became popular. Gaming has proven that it can be a lucrative career for those who are good at it. While players such as Ninja and Tfue have been known to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">earn as much as</a> $500,000 a month from this platform, they were not the highest Fortnite earners of 2019.</p><p class=align-left>Top <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">five highest paid</a> Fortnite players of 2019 were:</p><li>Bugha - $3,052,800</li><li>psalm - $1,865,800</li><li>Aquav2 - $1,625,207.56</li><li>Nyhrox - $1,513,176.49</li><li>EpikWhale - $1,277,550</li><p class=align-left>In spite of this, Ninja beats them all because, while most of them earn their money from tournaments, he earns his income from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">multiple business ventures</a>.
