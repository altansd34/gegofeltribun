According to a new report, Underwood’s husband Mike Fisher was against her joining the show, as he worried about how she’ll balance her busy schedule.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-was-carrie-underwood-s-husband-against-american-idol>Was Carrie Underwood’s Husband Against American Idol?</h2><p>“Mike didn’t want her to do&nbsp;Idol&nbsp;initially, but she insisted, and the paycheck is substantial,” a source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Life & Style</a>. “Mike is worried Carrie won’t be able to balance her life, commuting between Tennessee and L.A. It’s a huge adjustment, more than her residency in Las Vegas, which they never saw eye to eye on, either.”</p><p>Underwood is estimated to be making $25 million for her new job on Idol. The singer has been busy the past few years with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her Las Vegas residency</a>, which kicked off in 2021. Underwood is performing several shows in Vegas this fall, and she’s added more dates in 2025.</p><p>The country star wed Fisher, a former hockey player, in 2010. The couple shares two sons together — Isaiah, 9, and Jacob, 5. According to a source, Fisher is “a little concerned she may perform poorly under pressure” as an American Idol judge.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LUKE BRYAN SHARES ADVICE FOR NEW ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ JUDGE CARRIE UNDERWOOD</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-underwood-is-under-a-lot-of-pressure>Underwood Is ‘Under a Lot of Pressure’</h2><p>Even Underwood is reportedly concerned about how the pressure of joining American Idol might affect her performance as a judge. A source told Life & Style that she’s “stressed out,” adding, “Though she isn’t admitting it, Carrie thinks she may have taken on too much.”</p><p>“Haters claim Carrie will have a hard time living up to Katy [Perry], who was outrageous and a great mentor,” the source shared. “Carrie is&nbsp;desperate to prove&nbsp;she will not only thrive but can also bring in the ratings.”</p><p>Underwood will sit on the panel with longtime judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan. A premiere date has yet to be announced for Season 23, but fans can expect it to be sometime in early 2025.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_BenAffleck_JenniferLopez_Christopher-Polk_Golden-Globes-2024_Golden-Globes-2024-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Jennifer Lopez Files for Divorce from Ben Affleck" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>carrie underwood</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Mike Fisher</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqpq6GVYsKvsMSrrqinlKh6qcHSm5innF2nsrG70a2cnaSpYrGqsM2tZLCZnql6qbHRZquoZZqktq95wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./46030-britons-support-id-cards-cctv-monitoring-and-finge.html><span>←</span><span>Britons support ID cards, CCTV monitoring and fingerprint database</span></a>
