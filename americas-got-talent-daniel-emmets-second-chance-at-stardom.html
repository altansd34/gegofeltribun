It did not take long for the singer to witness first hand how quickly his chance at fame could be taken away from him. After judge Simon Cowell knew that Daniel’s original audition song wasn’t the right fit, he gave him another shot at getting his audition right. Daniel rose to the occasion not once, but twice, and went on to be a star throughout his season.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daniel-s-early-beginnings>Daniel’s Early Beginnings</h2><p>Daniel was born in Rochester, New York, and began training to become an opera singer at 15 years old. The singer calls himself a crossover artist. At a young age Daniel taught himself how to sing in seven different languages. The singers can perform in English, French, German, Italian, Latin,&nbsp;Russian, and Spanish. Daniel moved to Las Vegas to take voice lessons at 16 years old. He began singing at cabarets on the Vegas strip before he could drink.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Daniel’s First Major Performance</h2><p>The singer’s first major performance was at a charity gala event for the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation when he was only in high school. Daniel continues to work with the organization. The foundation provides social, educational, financial, and psychological support services and programs to families of all children diagnosed with life threatening or critical illnesses. Pop icon Britney Spears also worked with the group.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Daniel Is Huge in Las Vegas</h2><p>The singer had a huge and loyal fan base before he walked onto the America’s Got Talent stage. After moving to LA, Daniel started to perform in&nbsp;The Cocktail Cabaret&nbsp;at Caesar’s Palace in&nbsp;Las Vegas. The show became a huge draw. He has also performed with Broadway and Carnegie Hall pianist Philip Fortenberry. The two have formed a friendship that spectators continue to enjoy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rollercoaster ‘America’s Got Talent’ Ride</h2><p>Season 13 wasn’t Daniel’s first time auditioning for America’s Got Talent. The singer made it past the first round of auditions before being cut in Season 6. Daniel’s fans finally saw him when his audition was televised during Season 13 of the competition show. This is where things got interesting for the singer. Cowell stopped Daniel midway through his performance of his original song “Amante.” Cowell was willing to give the singer a second chance but asked if he had another song to sing. Daniel did not have another song rehearsed.</p><p>Cowell then suggested a song called “Passerá.” The song was most famously recorded in 2004 by Il Divo, who were a group formed by Cowell. Daniel only had one hour to learn the song. The singer took the challenge head-on and wowed the judges to receive all yeses.</p><p>Daniel’s excitement was cut short when he was eliminated in the Judge Cuts. In another moment of chances the singer was brought back for the first round of live shows as a wildcard. Daniel made it to the finals of his season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life Back in Las Vegas</h2><p>Daniel is not too far from America’s Got Talent Live! Las Vegas show. He has released his version of “Passerà” which debuted at number two on the iTunes Classical Chart. Daniel has also been featured on the CW’s&nbsp;The Big Stage&nbsp;and in 2019 debuted on the&nbsp;Las Vegas&nbsp;strip as a headliner at&nbsp;Caesars Palace. The singer continues to perform solo shows as well as guest star on tour with <a href=#>Marie Osmond</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/163200_7119-1.jpg alt="Meet ‘American Idol’s Award Winning Songwriter Leah Marlene" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlsBus86tZK2ZnJq7tXnDmqWinZxisq65xK2qZquVmLyvsIycn5qmk5p6osCMrKuaqpSkunA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./bgt-judge-amanda-holden-48-refuses-to-age-watch-her-bikini-body-skills-video.html><span>'BGT' Judge Amanda Holden, 48, Refuses To Age Watch Her Bikini Body Skills [VIDEO]</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
