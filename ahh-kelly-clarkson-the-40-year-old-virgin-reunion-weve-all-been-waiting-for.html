With hilarious and cringey situations and one-liners, the movie quickly became a comedy classic. Now, judge of<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> The Voice </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Clarkson</a> is calling out Seth Rogen for including her in the comedy lore.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-confronts-seth-rogen-about-writing-her-into-the-40-year-old-virgin>Kelly Clarkson Confronts Seth Rogen About Writing Her Into ‘The 40-Year-Old Virgin’</h2><p>In one of the movie’s funniest scenes, Carell’s character gets a chest wax in order to make himself more attractive. Because of the extraordinary amount of chest hair he has, the process is quite painful. In a series of rips, he screams some of the funniest lines in the movie. As it turns out, the most notable line was written by Rogen.</p><p>On The Kelly Clarkson Show, Clarkson got to the bottom of why she was a line in the movie at all.</p><p>“He [Judd Apatow] told me that it’s your fault people scream my name everywhere I go,” Clarkson said to Rogen during a video interview. “It doesn’t matter how many hits, what I do in life. I could save a family from drowning, fires, anything, and literally the one thing people know me from is ‘ahh Kelly Clarkson!'”</p><p>One of the reasons why the line is so funny is that it’s so incredibly random. Why would a 40-year-old virgin in the middle of his first chest wax be thinking of Kelly Clarkson? Why is that the name he screams out?</p><p>Rogen, who was co-producer and co-star of the film, apologizes to Clarkson for being the reason people scream at her wherever she goes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p>“We knew that Carell was going to be waxed and he wasn’t going to be able to think clearly,” he said. “So we wanted to feed him [jokes] and we don’t like to always have profanities. I honestly think I was sitting on my couch writing the jokes and you came on television and I saw you.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rogen-talks-comedy-writing-brainstorming-process>Rogen Talks Comedy Writing, Brainstorming Process</h3><p>He went on to explain the insider-tip that words with a “k” sound are funnier than other words. A comedy writing technique is to throw words with that sound in to bits for a larger chance at landing.</p><p>Rogen even shared his actual notes from the joke’s brainstorming session. Viewers could see Clarkson’s name between “BURGER-PANTIES” and “THROBBING-MONKEY-TAIL.” The host also told Rogen not to apologize as she’s a huge fan of the movie <strong>—</strong> just maybe not a huge fan of the popularity it’s brought her.</p><p>“I could be in Japan, it doesn’t matter where the hell I am,” she said. “‘Since You Been Gone,’ never heard of it. But Kelly Clarkson’s name being yelled in the middle of a waxing: that people know.”</p><p>You can catch Clarkson Monday and Tuesday nights on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a> for more hilarious moments and behind-the-scenes fun.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/The-Ellen-DeGeneres-Show-Ending-Ellen-DeGeneres-The-Ellen-DeGeneres-Show-Season-19-Portia-de-Rossi-scaled-1.jpeg alt="Ellen DeGeneres Ends Talk Show After 19 Seasons" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKGfZqOVobm6ecKlmKujo6S7bsDHnmRtaF2usqK%2BjKijnWWmnr%2Botc1mqZ6tnp68r3nWnq2eZZGhuW6uxJ6lZq%2BRnsGqusZmnaiqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./x-factor-star-danny-tetley-behind-bars-after-admitting-to-sexually-exploiting-teens.html><span>←</span><span>'X Factor' Star Danny Tetley Behind Bars After Admitting To Sexually Exploiting Teens</span></a>
