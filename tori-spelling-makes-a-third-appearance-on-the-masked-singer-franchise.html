After appearing in the U.S. and Australia’s versions of the show, Spelling participated in the French version of the&nbsp;reality game show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-spelling-teased-the-cat-costume-on-the-masked-singer-france>Spelling Teased The Cat Costume on The Masked Singer France</h2><p>The 49-year-old actress did appearances as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Unicorn</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Poodle</a> on the U.S. and Australia versions of the show respectively. Her latest and third run on the show is in The Masked Singer France, wearing The Cat costume.</p><p>While disguised as The Cat, Spelling sang “Price Tag,” by Jessie J, and performed with a feminine personality mostly seen in the 90s. The given clues were not enough for the panelists to correctly guess her identity.</p><p>Guesses ranged from Brenda Walsh to Beyoncé, but it was ultimately Spelling who was hiding behind The Cat costume. Spelling explained the reason behind her guest participation in the show after getting unmasked.</p><p>“I agreed to participate in The Masked Singer in France because I was always afraid to perform in public,” she said.</p><p>Basically, she doesn’t feel the same type of fear while masked on the show. Instead, she’s more comfortable performing.</p><p>“Participating in&nbsp;The Masked Singer in France was a crazy and fun experience. A real dream.” She added.&nbsp;“But above all, I was able to regain my self-confidence by realizing that I could perform on a stage in public.”</p><p>Spelling said almost the same speech after&nbsp;taking off her unicorn mask, stating that singing in front of an audience is her biggest fear. The actress also makes regular appearances in RuPaul’s Drag Race, MasterChef Celebrity Family Showdown, and Celebrity Show-Off.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Spelling Secretly Split With her Husband?</h2><p>Rumors are circulating around the internet that Spelling’s relationship with her husband Dean McDermott isn’t going great. McDermott’s new appearance with a shaven head and not wearing their wedding ring might have just confirmed everyone’s suspicion.</p><p>The pair recently lost a close friend and publicist Scout Masterson on September 11. Spelling posted a heartfelt tribute to the family friend on her Instagram.</p><p>An insider revealed that the marriage between Spelling and McDermott is over and has been for a long time now. They have tried to make it work for the sake of the kids but they truly do not get along. Spelling has met with her lawyers and is planning to file a divorce very soon according to the insider.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_ChapelHart_DariusRucker_AGT_Trae-Patton_NBC.jpg alt="Chapel Hart Releases New Song ‘Ol’ Church Hymn’ with Darius Rucker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706ipomWjpbKtuMinnmalkaCytHnAZquhoaKZeqK8z56Yq5memLJuu81mq6GdXaKutLfEnWSsoZ6csrN5xauYp5uYnsCmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-hanks-and-rita-wilson-celebrate-36th-anniversary-fans-spot-a-curious-detail-in-their-pics-818747.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Celebrate 36th Anniversary, Fans Spot a Curious Detail in Their Pics</span></a>
