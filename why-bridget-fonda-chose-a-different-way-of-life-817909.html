Bridget didn’t just retire; she disappeared.

Fonda acted in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many movies during her short time in&nbsp;the spotlight, about 15&nbsp;years or&nbsp;so. What’s interesting is&nbsp;that she had a&nbsp;really cool acting career, but then it&nbsp;just suddenly stopped."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Her last big movie was <i>Kiss of&nbsp;the Dragon</i> in&nbsp;2001, which did really well at&nbsp;the box office. There wasn’t a&nbsp;slow decline in&nbsp;her career like some other actors.</p><p>That’s why people sometimes wonder why she vanished.</p><p><h2>She was never happy with her successful acting careeer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d86/748/2e96cb58b0a62c92cde2d7e784.jpg><p>Throughout her career, she often felt uneasy talking about herself, like wearing a&nbsp;scratchy sweater that she didn’t choose. Once, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, she wondered aloud about her lack of&nbsp;confidence, saying, «<strong>I’m trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy with my&nbsp;career</strong>. I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I should give myself a&nbsp;break, but I’ve got this bug that rides&nbsp;me, ‘You should be&nbsp;doing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>better</a>.’» She opened up&nbsp;that every time she worked, she was frustrated with her physical inability to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her mental picture.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;others who succeeded without family connections in&nbsp;showbiz, she admitted when she saw people from non-showbiz families making&nbsp;it, she was impressed by&nbsp;their efforts. But she struggled to&nbsp;credit herself because she always considered nepotism as&nbsp;a&nbsp;factor.</p><p><h2>She decided to&nbsp;build her life as&nbsp;she imagined&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d79/f19/b2c6e75bea954639032620b0c4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her final big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interviews</a>, she shared a&nbsp;story that seemed to&nbsp;explain everything that happened afterwards: her sudden stop in&nbsp;acting, disappearing from the spotlight, and choosing a&nbsp;regular life. It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;early 1997, she remembered, when she was really sick with the flu. She fell into a&nbsp;deep sadness, crying over simple things like the brightness of&nbsp;the sunlight outside her window, without understanding why. Finally, feeling overwhelmed, <strong>she reached out to&nbsp;her mom for support</strong>.</p><p><strong>Her mom explained</strong> that Bridget’s feelings were normal at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain point in&nbsp;life when you realize that life doesn’t just happen to&nbsp;you; you have to&nbsp;actively create&nbsp;it. And when you consider&nbsp;it, whether we&nbsp;agree or&nbsp;not, she kind of&nbsp;did just that.</p><p><h2>After the car crash, she disappeared.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c60/f97/51dd8f560e96f6171415ecab07.jpg><p>face to face/REPORTER/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2002, Bridget decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>retire</a> from acting to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;her relationship and start a&nbsp;family. She <strong>married famous musician Danny Elfman in&nbsp;2003</strong>, and they welcomed their son, Oliver, in&nbsp;2005. Since then, Bridget has mostly kept a&nbsp;low profile and stayed away from Hollywood, although she’s occasionally seen here and there.</p><p>On&nbsp;February&nbsp;28, 2003, Bridget had a&nbsp;scary experience when<strong> she lost control of&nbsp;her car</strong>, and it&nbsp;flipped down a&nbsp;hill. Despite the car being completely wrecked, Bridget only suffered minor cuts and bruises, according to&nbsp;The New York Post.
