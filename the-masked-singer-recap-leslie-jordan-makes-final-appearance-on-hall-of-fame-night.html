Venus Fly Trap was revealed to be George Foreman, and Gopher turned out to be George Clinton.</strong> <strong>Meanwhile, Bride moved on to the next episode.</strong></p><p>Wednesday’s episode also marked the final appearance from beloved guest panelist Leslie Jordan, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sadly passed away</a> last month. He and Joel McHale filled in for regular panelist Ken Jeong, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who missed the show</a> due to Covid-19.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bride-moves-on-to-next-week-s-the-masked-singer>Bride Moves on to Next Week’s ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>The panelists were shocked when they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">heard Bride perform</a> during Wednesday’s episode. They assumed there was a female celebrity in the costume, which takes the form of a pink dragon wearing a wedding dress. However, the voice told them otherwise.</p><p>Bride teased that they have a “rugged personality” and have sold out arenas. They also said they have an “appetite for destroying things.” For their first performance, Bride sang “Shut Up and Dance” by Walk the Moon, prompting Jenny McCarthy to say they sound like a rock star.</p><p>Joel McHale said he thinks Bride is putting on a fake British accent to throw the panelists off. Guesses included David Coverdale and Carrot Top. Next week, Bride will go up against two new contestants for a shot at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">joining Harp and the Lambs</a> in the Semifinals.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RYAN REYNOLDS RECALLS ‘TRAUMATIC’ EXPERIENCE ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ IN SOUTH KOREA</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-venus-fly-trap-gopher-are-george-foreman-george-clinton>Venus Fly Trap, Gopher Are George Foreman, George Clinton</h2><p>Wednesday’s new episode featured two unmaskings. The first to be unmasked was Venus Fly Trap, who sang “Get Ready” by the Temptations. Nicole Scherzinger said he had her favorite costume. Guesses included Mike Tyson and Charles Barkley, but only Robin Thicke correctly guessed that it was former boxer George Foreman.</p><p>Gopher also performed on Wednesday night, singing “It’s Your Thing” by the Isley Brothers. After Venus Fly Trap was eliminated, Gopher and Bride went head to head in a Battle Royale to “All Star” by Smash Mouth, with Sheila E. on drums.</p><p>The panel chose to send Bride to the next round, meaning Gopher had to be unmasked. Guesses included Flavor Flav and George Wallace. However, only Thicke and Scherzinger were correct in guessing it was funk musician George Clinton.</p><p>The Masked Singer will return next Wednesday night for a Comedy Roast Special, as Bride takes on two new contestants.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MeghanTrainor_weightLoss-220x165.jpg alt="Meghan Trainor Looks Unrecognizable After Losing 60 Pounds" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>leslie jordan</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6s7HCmqdmpJWouaqxjKOmq5yRo3qurcqeqmaemaOurXnAqaeemaKWu6SxjKilZqCRobluu8VmnZqllWK7qrPHrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1500747-kendu-isaacs-biography-mary-j-bliges-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Kendu Isaacs biography: who is Mary J.
