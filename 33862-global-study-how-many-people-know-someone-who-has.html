This includes 6% who say they themselves have confirmation they have had the disease, as well as 34% whose family has been affected and 33% whose friends caught it. (The figures don’t sum to 63% as for some people will have known people from more than one category who caught the disease).</p><p>Close behind are America, Poland and Italy, where 58-60% of people know someone who has tested positive for the virus.</p><p>Here in Britain, 57% know of someone who has been confirmed with the virus. One in twenty Britons (5%) say they have tested positive for COVID-19, with a quarter (26%) saying this has happened to a family member and 36% to a close friend.</p><p>People in China (4%) and Singapore (6%) are the least likely to know anyone who has definitely had the disease.</p><h3>How many people know someone who has become seriously unwell from COVID-19?</h3><p>Americans and Poles are the most likely to know someone whose health has been seriously harmed by coronavirus, at 33% and 31% respectively.</p><p>Spanish people (28%), Italians (27%) and Britons (27%) are also among the more likely to have seen someone close to them become severely sick from the disease.</p><h3>How many people know someone who has died from COVID-19?</h3><p>Americans and Italians are the most likely have lost a friend or family member to COVID-19, at 21%. (It is worth noting a separate YouGov poll conducted more recently in the US alone has that figure even higher, at 29%).</p><p>One in five Spanish and Polish people (19%) also say that someone close to them has died from the diseases, as do 18% of urban Indians.</p><p>Here in Britain, coronavirus has taken the life of someone close to one in eight Britons (13%). One in twenty Britons (5%) have lost seen a family member succumb to the disease, with 8% having lost a close friend.</p><p>People in China and Singapore are the least likely to have lost someone they love to the disease, at just 2% in each country.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZmxraGt%2FbrPLqJmapF2owbaw2GafqK9doq6vxYypnKionJp6rLrOsGSsp52avK%2BxjLCfqGWYlsBu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1461065-gabrielle-union-daughter-kaavia-melt-hearts-matching-outfit-movie-premiere.html><span>←</span><span>Gabrielle Union and Daughter Kaavia Melt Hearts in Matching Outfit for Movie premiere</span></a>
