The principal performer is&nbsp;called a&nbsp;premier danseur, principal dancer, or&nbsp;soloist.</p></li><li readability=7.7922077922078><p>At&nbsp;first, the main parts were often performed by&nbsp;<a href=#>men</a>, although early ballets still often had female performers. At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the nineteenth century, romantic ballets became less popular. Characters like The Sylph became main characters, while the ballerinas who played their roles <a href=#>started</a> to&nbsp;become increasingly important. Men, in&nbsp;their turn, became the secondary players.</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90c/2a6/ddc972544d950330edcfe9997a.jpg><ul readability=3.341008089608><li>There are still numerous myths about men in&nbsp;ballet. In&nbsp;1988, sociologist William L. Earl <a href=#>explored</a> the existing stereotypes among Americans, asking middle-class people to&nbsp;describe male ballet dancers using up&nbsp;to&nbsp;15&nbsp;words and phrases. Most of&nbsp;the responses he&nbsp;got were that they displayed feminine attributes and qualities, behaviors, and an&nbsp;unconventional sexual orientation.</li><li readability=9.8736176935229>The dancer Aaron Cota <a href=#>stood up</a>&nbsp;against unfair prejudice and helped to&nbsp;bust the myths.<p>He&nbsp;took a&nbsp;break in&nbsp;his career to&nbsp;enter the Marine Corps. He&nbsp;shared the reaction of&nbsp;his marine fellows, which included questions like, “What? You’re what?” The dancer explained, “They didn’t understand&nbsp;me, but at&nbsp;the same time, it&nbsp;was simply necessary to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;them what ballet is&nbsp;all about. When the fellows from my&nbsp;unit saw some of&nbsp;the fragments of&nbsp;my&nbsp;dancing or&nbsp;videos of&nbsp;other dancing guys, they were impressed. ’How can they do&nbsp;that? Wow, that’s amazing,’ and ’That kind of&nbsp;opened my&nbsp;eyes...’”</p></li><li>The former ballet dancer, and now the head of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Russian Ballet School for Children and Adults</a>, Vladimir Ippolitov, told <strong>Bright Side</strong> that the stereotypes about the profession of&nbsp;a&nbsp;ballet dancer are still there. “I&nbsp;usually recommend watching the performances of&nbsp;Mikhail Baryshnikov&nbsp;— there is&nbsp;nothing feminine in&nbsp;them. I&nbsp;generally think that ballet is&nbsp;the most masculine profession because they hold women on&nbsp;their arms,” Vladimir said.</li><li>Moreover, according to&nbsp;Vladimir, in&nbsp;Russia, viewers perceive dancing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>job</a>, while in&nbsp;Europe, it’s treated more like a&nbsp;<a href=#>hobby</a>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06a/21d/62c8ef53028a0319bf58f76479.jpg><ul><li>Ballet dancers can benefit from these myths. The low popularity of&nbsp;the profession among men leads to&nbsp;the fact that <a href=#>competition</a> among artists is&nbsp;lower than with their female colleagues. Moreover, choreographic schools often <a href=#>offer</a> boys <a href=#>free tuition</a> to&nbsp;attract them, while girls usually have to&nbsp;pay certain fees.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33e/6f6/3c8baf582fb9764c4a5707668b.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65d/740/2fa10e5eaca5b2ae1a197a07f7.jpg><ul><li>Instead of&nbsp;pointe shoes, male ballet dancers <a href=#>wear</a> slippers with a&nbsp;soft sole on&nbsp;their feet, tights on&nbsp;their legs, and a&nbsp;jerkin, which is&nbsp;something like a&nbsp;short close-fitting jacket. Many people wonder why ballet dancers’ underwear can’t be&nbsp;seen under their tights. The thing is&nbsp;that dancers <a href=#>use</a> seamless types of&nbsp;special underwear, called a&nbsp;dance belt, which is&nbsp;unnoticeable from under their tights.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/398/240/de7f23537ba9e883b2bfda64b4.jpg><ul><li>Another advantage male ballet dancers have is&nbsp;that they don’t have to&nbsp;keep to&nbsp;a&nbsp;diet, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule. Girls often have to&nbsp;follow their weight so&nbsp;that their partners can give them support. Men don’t have these issues. In&nbsp;fact, male dancers may need to&nbsp;eat more than average in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;their <a href=#>energy</a>. However, they have to&nbsp;fulfill another difficult task&nbsp;— lift their female partners, sometimes on&nbsp;one arm, which requires a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;upper <a href=#>body strength</a>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a9/71f/8c430855408a2bf6ad2d7e04a2.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dda/ad6/4b01c35ff3acd921dd7b15a7d6.jpg><ul><li><a href=#>Ballet dancers</a> don’t get paid very well for having such a&nbsp;strenuous job that puts them at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;high risk for injury. Of&nbsp;course, this doesn’t apply to&nbsp;principal dancers.</li><li>By&nbsp;the way, it’s much easier for tall men to&nbsp;become principal dancers but short men have a&nbsp;chance too. For example, thanks to&nbsp;his technique and charisma, <a href=#>Mikhail Baryshnikov</a> became a&nbsp;ballet star at&nbsp;only 5′ 5″.</li></ul><p>How do&nbsp;you relate to&nbsp;male ballet dancers?
