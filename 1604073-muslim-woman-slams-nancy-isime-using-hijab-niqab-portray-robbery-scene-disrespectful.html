The Niqab is not a costume, you do not use it to represent unspeakable things in the society. There are other things you could use, you chose to use the niqab. Before you come under this post to throw tantrums and tell me it is no business of mine to make a review about this, you should see this. My issue with the use of hijab and niqab in what obviously looks like a robbery scene, that makes no sense. Hijab is not a costume, it should not be used for such.”<p class=align-left>Speaking further, Adiba noted that <a href=#>Nigeria</a> has been facing a lot of problems, including hate and tribal wars. She then asked Nancy why she wanted to add religious war to the mix. The Muslim woman wondered why boundaries could not be maintained instead of constantly disrespecting people’s faiths just to promote a source of income.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/9572288c0d816fc9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Carolyna Hutchings laments about skyrocketing food prices, advises protesters: "Tell your APC govt"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Adiba said that other face coverings could have been used for a robbery scene instead of a hijab and niqab.</p><p class=align-left>In her words:</p>“We are going through a lot already in Nigeria, there’s too much hardship and we have too much hate and tribal problems in Nigeria. Why would you want to introduce religious war? Why can’t you maintain boundaries instead of consistently trying to disrespect people’s faith just because you want to promote what brings food to your table? There are many alternative face coverings that could be used in this scene instead of the niqab and the hijab. This is not just another costume or fashion attire, it is an identity, a symbol of modesty and a representation of somebody’s faith.”<p class=align-left>The Muslim woman further expressed her frustration about non-Muslims using Islamic clothing in negative ways. She said:</p>“I am sick and tired of constantly seeing the people who do not share the same values as we do use this outfit in a despicable way for their own selfish interest to promote immorality and bad image for Muslims and those who adorn themselves with it. You people have chosen to defame, diminish and belittle the entire character of Muslim women around the world for a costume that can be improvised.

In her words:</p>"I genuinely believe that a responsible producer, scriptwriter, or actress would create a movie to correct negative stereotypes instead of feeding into the ignorance of the bandwagon. A few years back, we had to fight for the right not to take off our hijab when we are being called to bar as lawyers. Many people who have never had a conversation with a hijabi or even understand that we truly never take these things off outside the house had hot takes and illinformed articles to share. We typically mind our business and leave everyone alone. The least the rest of you can do is leave us alone in return."<h2>How Christian man dragged Asake over video</h2><p class=align-left>In other news, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> reported that a popular Nigerian singer, Asake, was <a href=#>called out by a Christian </a>man over his part in the music video for Bandana song.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b6446de5a0e0305d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Teni elicits laughter as she refuses to pay bouncer N1m daily in the UK: "I can't afford it"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The YBNL star with the real name Ahmed Ololade was featured on Fireboy DML’s Bandana track, and the music video showed him inside a church in some scenes.</p><p class=align-left>In a new development, a Nigerian man has spoken up on behalf of Christians and has given Asake 24 hours to take down the music video.</p><p class=align-left><i>Proofreading by Nkem Ikeke, journalist and copy editor at Legit.ng.</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZqbmBpfXh%2FjKasrKSZonq4u8yapWarnJa6tHnNmqWcsV2ewKq5xGasrKGenHqptcmamWammaauo3nPqKmtqpGuerO7wZucq7FdqLCmusRmm6KroprAsbHCrZ2upF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melinda-messenger.html><span>←</span><span>Melinda Messenger popularity &amp;amp; fame</span></a>
