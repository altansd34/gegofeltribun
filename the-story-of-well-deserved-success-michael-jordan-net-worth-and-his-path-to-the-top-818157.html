He&nbsp;grew taller and got better at&nbsp;basketball, becoming one of&nbsp;the best players in&nbsp;the country.

He&nbsp;kept pushing himself and working hard, which eventually led him to&nbsp;become one of&nbsp;the greatest basketball players of&nbsp;all time.

Even though he&nbsp;was busy playing basketball professionally, he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;finish his bachelor’s degree in&nbsp;geography in&nbsp;1986. It&nbsp;was important to&nbsp;him to&nbsp;complete his <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a>, even with his busy basketball career.</p><p><h2>Throughout his professional career, he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;true legend.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b40/ab7/903ead5d63a179ae9e40945710.jpg><p>When Jordan entered the NBA, he&nbsp;immediately <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>showed</a> how good he&nbsp;was. <strong>Nobody could match his mix of&nbsp;athleticism, talent, and drive to&nbsp;win.

Along the way, he&nbsp;got five MVP awards.

The first time was in&nbsp;October 1993, which surprised many fans. However, he&nbsp;didn’t stay retired for long. He&nbsp;came back to&nbsp;play again in&nbsp;the 1993-94&nbsp;season, showing that his love for the game was too strong to&nbsp;keep him away for too long.</p><p><h2>Quickly, Jordan was approached by&nbsp;Nike and offered a&nbsp;collaboration, that became truly legendary!</h2></p><p>When Michael Jordan started his rookie year in&nbsp;1984, big shoe companies like Adidas, Converse, and <a href=# title=Nike data-link=tag>Nike</a> all <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wanted</a> him to&nbsp;sign deals with them. Nike made a&nbsp;special presentation for Jordan. T<strong>hey showed him a&nbsp;video of&nbsp;his best slam dunks, set to&nbsp;the song «Jump (For My&nbsp;Love)» by&nbsp;the Pointer Sisters.</strong> Nike also showed Jordan the first <a href=# title=design data-link=tag>design</a> of&nbsp;their shoe. But Jordan didn’t like the colors they picked.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;1984, Nike was having a&nbsp;tough time, but everything <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changed</a> when they signed a&nbsp;deal with a&nbsp;young NBA player, Michael Jordan. <strong>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rookie in&nbsp;1984, Jordan </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>signed</strong></a><strong> a&nbsp;five-year, $2.5 million deal with Nike. </strong>They also gave him his own line of&nbsp;shoes, called Air Jordan, which was a&nbsp;big deal in&nbsp;the NBA world.</p><p>Unlike other companies, Nike listened to&nbsp;Jordan’s feedback. They wanted to&nbsp;make him more than just someone who sold shoes. They wanted to&nbsp;make him a&nbsp;star with his own shoe line.</p><p><strong>The first Air Jordan shoe, the iconic Black and Red design, was a&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>huge</strong></a><strong> hit. It&nbsp;cost $60 in&nbsp;stores, but in&nbsp;just one year, it&nbsp;made a&nbsp;whopping $126 million in&nbsp;sales. </strong>That smashed the expected sales of&nbsp;$3&nbsp;million in&nbsp;four years! According to&nbsp;Forbes, by&nbsp;2019, the Air Jordan brand was valued at&nbsp;$3&nbsp;billion, and Michael Jordan’s lifetime deal with Nike was worth an&nbsp;incredible $1.3&nbsp;billion.</p><p><strong>The famous «Jumpman» </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>logo</strong></a><strong> came from a&nbsp;photo shoot Jordan did for Life magazine in&nbsp;1984.</strong> This was before he&nbsp;even signed with Nike. In&nbsp;the photo, Jordan posed like a&nbsp;ballet move called a&nbsp;grand jeté while wearing his Olympic uniform and New Balance basketball shoes. When Peter Moore, who was designing Jordan’s shoes, saw this picture, he&nbsp;used it&nbsp;as&nbsp;inspiration for the logo. <strong>The «Jumpman» logo has changed over time but remains one of&nbsp;the most recognizable symbols in&nbsp;sports, appearing on&nbsp;shoes, clothes, hats, and more.</strong></p><p><h2>But other big brands wanted to&nbsp;collaborate with the great player almost immediately, too!</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/734/58e/ebc8e75c8780ea45d7355dbfbd.jpg><p><strong>During the 1980s, Michael Jordan worked with </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Coca-Cola</strong></a><strong> on&nbsp;many commercials.</strong> But when his contract ended, Coca-Cola didn’t offer him the deal he&nbsp;wanted: a&nbsp;10-year contract worth millions. Gatorade, which was owned by&nbsp;Quaker Oats at&nbsp;the time, saw their chance and gave Jordan exactly what he&nbsp;asked for. <strong>They signed him to&nbsp;a&nbsp;10-year deal worth $13.5 million in&nbsp;1991.</strong></p><p>Jordan and Gatorade have had a&nbsp;strong partnership ever since. Since 1991, Jordan has appeared in&nbsp;more than 20&nbsp;Gatorade commercials. One of&nbsp;the most famous ones is&nbsp;the «Be&nbsp;Like Mike» ad, where kids sing about wanting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like Jordan.

This deal happened during his rookie year in&nbsp;1984, and he&nbsp;got paid $200,000 for&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;was just the beginning of&nbsp;his long list of&nbsp;lucrative endorsement deals that would follow as&nbsp;he&nbsp;became one of&nbsp;the most famous athletes in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>In&nbsp;1992, McDonald’s introduced the McJordan Burger, a&nbsp;special limited-edition <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>burger</a>, and even had Michael Jordan appear in&nbsp;their commercials to&nbsp;promote&nbsp;it. <strong>This made Jordan the first celebrity ever to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;meal named after him at&nbsp;McDonald’s.</strong></p><p>Another memorable McDonald’s commercial starred Michael Jordan and Larry Bird. In&nbsp;this ad&nbsp;from 1993, the two basketball legends competed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;game of&nbsp;HORSE for the prize of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Big Mac and some fries. <strong>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;fun and iconic moment, bringing together two of&nbsp;the biggest names in&nbsp;sports for a&nbsp;playful competition over a&nbsp;classic McDonald’s meal.</strong> These commercials added to&nbsp;Jordan’s status not only as&nbsp;a&nbsp;basketball legend but also as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pop culture icon</p><p><h2>So, what is&nbsp;Michael Jordan net worth now?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a58/3cb/34bd225270a8ea83e7058b6db7.jpg><p><strong>When the original </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Air Jordan</strong></a><strong> shoe hit stores towards the end of&nbsp;Michael Jordan’s rookie season in&nbsp;the NBA in&nbsp;1985, Nike thought they might sell about $3&nbsp;million worth of&nbsp;shoes. </strong>But just two months later, they had already made $70 million in&nbsp;sales. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the year, that number had jumped to&nbsp;$100&nbsp;million, according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;study from Temple University in&nbsp;2023.
