Salma <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a>, “It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;silly. We&nbsp;started talking about football. We’re both crazy about soccer. Then we&nbsp;started talking about science. We&nbsp;love space and physics, and he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;smart, charming, and funny.” Only later did she realize Francois-Henri was the perfect person for her.</p><p><h2>They have a&nbsp;large family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/51a/224/335e2e568596bb393e95e321c0.jpg><p>Salma and Francois-Henri have 4&nbsp;<a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a>. Salma is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stepmom</a> to&nbsp;3&nbsp;children from her husband’s past relationship, and she considers herself blessed to&nbsp;have them in&nbsp;her life. Additionally, Salma has one biological child named Valentina, whom she gave <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>birth</a> to&nbsp;when she was 41&nbsp;years old. Salma shares, “I&nbsp;always wanted to&nbsp;have many children, and&nbsp;I wasn’t able&nbsp;to. My&nbsp;body, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;miracle, had one.”</p><p><h2>Salma posted a&nbsp;personal photo on&nbsp;Instagram.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17b/f8a/03965f56359d92a1e8139f383b.jpg><p>Hayek’s husband celebrated his 61st birthday on&nbsp;Sunday, and Salma showed her love for her wealthy husband on&nbsp;Instagram. In&nbsp;the photo, Salma hugs Francois-Henri tightly and gives him a&nbsp;sweet kiss on&nbsp;his cheek. She left a&nbsp;heartfelt message with the photo <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “Happy birthday, mi&nbsp;amor. You’re my&nbsp;sunshine, my&nbsp;warmth, my&nbsp;light, my&nbsp;strength, my&nbsp;joy, my&nbsp;love.”</p><p><h2>The post faced a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;negative comments.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ab/92c/ad54f654b4a2998d713ce7ed5a.jpg><p>Not all fans were happy about the sweet message Salma <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wanted</a> to&nbsp;share with everyone. Some people noticed the visible difference in&nbsp;appearance between Salma and Francois-Henri. Someone even dared to&nbsp;ask, “Is&nbsp;he&nbsp;your grandpa?” or&nbsp;“Is&nbsp;he&nbsp;your dad?” Others accused her of&nbsp;marrying him just for his money. Thankfully, most fans were supportive and excited for the couple. One person wrote, “Happy birthday! You both look amazing together!”</p><p><h2>The age difference is&nbsp;actually not that big.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7b/ec7/a677225b859f35946a694b0d5f.jpg><p>Even though it&nbsp;may appear that Francois-Henri is&nbsp;significantly older than Salma, the truth is&nbsp;that the age <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>difference</a> is&nbsp;only 4&nbsp;years. Salma is&nbsp;56&nbsp;and was born in&nbsp;1966, while her husband is&nbsp;61&nbsp;and was born in&nbsp;1962. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;neither her “dad” nor her “grandpa.”</p><p><h2>Salma is&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;the rumors going around.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a40/620/5b7cae5df4876a3ba88d9ed41b.jpg><p>The famous actress is&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;the criticism she faces regarding her marriage. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a>, “I&nbsp;didn’t know who he&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;just heard or&nbsp;maybe read in&nbsp;a&nbsp;headline that you had married a&nbsp;very rich guy. I&nbsp;meet him, and I’m like, ‘this guy is&nbsp;so&nbsp;foxy, the confidence, his eyes, he’s so&nbsp;good-looking and charming.’ When I&nbsp;married him, everybody said, ‘It’s an&nbsp;arranged marriage, she’s marrying him for the money’ I’m like, ‘Whatever, think what you want.’ I&nbsp;don’t even get offended.”</p><p>You don’t need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;super rich to&nbsp;look good; Salma is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great example. She doesn’t <a href=#>work</a> out often but stays active throughout the day. She enjoys simple activities like swimming and going for walks, which are her favorite ways to&nbsp;stay active.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMawwYyopaWxXaKus77InptmoJmieqe70WaroZ1doryvsdhmqpqknZZ6qa3YnqJmmZSZv6a%2F0p6qZqyYmnqjtculoKimkZ6%2FpnnHrqqbmZ6ZeqS7za2pqK6Vp8C6eZdqa2ptZWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./masked-singer-who-is-the-husky.html><span>←</span><span>Who is the Husky?
