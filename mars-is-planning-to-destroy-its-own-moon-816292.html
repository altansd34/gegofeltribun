I&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;around then. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;imagine this will result in&nbsp;a&nbsp;ring of&nbsp;debris around Mars, similar to&nbsp;Saturn’s rings. However, this process is&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural phenomenon and not an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;destruction by&nbsp;Mars.</p><p>Apparently, Phobos is&nbsp;getting ripped apart by&nbsp;the crazy gravitational forces of&nbsp;the Red Planet! But wait, there’s more! Phobos has these crazy parallel grooves all over its surface. We&nbsp;used to&nbsp;think they were from an&nbsp;asteroid crash, but now scientists think they’re actually from Mars’ intense gravity pulling the moon apart. Talk about a&nbsp;rough ride!</p><p>Scientists have this wild idea that when a&nbsp;little guy, like Phobos, gets too close to&nbsp;a&nbsp;big guy, like Mars, it&nbsp;starts to&nbsp;stretch out towards&nbsp;it. They call it&nbsp;the tidal force. Phobos is&nbsp;predicted to&nbsp;get stretched out so&nbsp;much that it’ll actually break apart! Crazy, right? And the debris from the moon will form a&nbsp;tiny ring around Mars, just like Saturn’s rings.</p><p>Now, some people thought that Phobos’ tiger stripes were caused by&nbsp;tidal forces before, but that theory got shut down because the moon is&nbsp;just too darn fluffy. But now, these genius researchers ran some computer simulations and found out that maybe there’s a&nbsp;hard-shell underneath all that fluff that could create grooves on&nbsp;the surface. But don’t worry at&nbsp;the rate Phobos is&nbsp;going, it’s going to&nbsp;crash into Mars in&nbsp;about forty million years. But if&nbsp;tidal forces are already tearing it&nbsp;apart, it&nbsp;might not even last that long!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0c7/2b5/54b8ca5f61933ac9c3b733e45a.png><p>However, we&nbsp;will still have the chance to&nbsp;learn more about Phobos. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>NASA</a> just picked ten rockstar researchers from all over the U.S. to&nbsp;join the Science Working Team for JAXA’s Martian Moons eXploration or&nbsp;just MMX&nbsp;mission! As&nbsp;NASA-supported participating scientists, they’ll be&nbsp;helping JAXA explore the two Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos.</p><p>And get this&nbsp;— they’re even planning to&nbsp;land on&nbsp;Phobos and grab a&nbsp;surface sample! The mission is&nbsp;set to&nbsp;launch in&nbsp;twenty twenty-four, and we’ll get our hands on&nbsp;that sample in&nbsp;twenty twenty-nine. Seven of&nbsp;the lucky researchers will be&nbsp;using the MMX flight instruments to&nbsp;conduct their research.</p><p>Phobos is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real oddball&nbsp;— it’s only seventeen miles wide and orbits Mars at&nbsp;a&nbsp;distance of&nbsp;three thousand seven hundred twenty-eight miles. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;precise. That’s way closer than Earth’s moon, which takes a&nbsp;whole twenty-seven days to&nbsp;orbit&nbsp;us. But Phobos is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;death-spiral towards Mars and is&nbsp;slowly falling towards the planet’s surface at&nbsp;a&nbsp;rate of&nbsp;six feet every one hundred years!</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>But there must be&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason why Mars is&nbsp;acting that nastily, right? What if&nbsp;it’s all just because of&nbsp;plain vengeance</a>? Okay, so&nbsp;picture this: Mars is&nbsp;minding its own business, being all hot and watery like a&nbsp;young Earth. It’s got a&nbsp;sweet magnetic field that’s protecting it&nbsp;from cosmic radiation and keeping its atmosphere nice and thick. Life is&nbsp;good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fe5/d46/7751635613920beb1ea92173b8.png><p>But then, at&nbsp;least twenty asteroids, each the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small country, come crashing down on&nbsp;Mars like a&nbsp;giant game of&nbsp;cosmic whack-a-mole. One of&nbsp;them even leaves a&nbsp;crater that’s almost two thousand miles wide.</p><p>Now imagine how Mars must feel with two asteroids being its moons after what other asteroids did to&nbsp;the Red Planet. All these impacts are like a&nbsp;massive punch to&nbsp;Mars’ gut, and its already weak magnetic field is&nbsp;knocked out cold. The core gets all overheated and can’t circulate properly, which means no&nbsp;more magnetic field to&nbsp;protect the planet.</p><p>It’s like if&nbsp;you were wearing nothing at&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;the Mariana Trench. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;was possible, you’d be&nbsp;defenseless! And chilly. That’s basically what happened to&nbsp;Mars. So&nbsp;now, poor Mars is&nbsp;out there in&nbsp;the cold, unprotected from all those nasty cosmic rays. It’s like going outside without sunscreen&nbsp;— not a&nbsp;good idea! But at&nbsp;least we&nbsp;can learn from Mars’ mistakes and make sure Earth doesn’t have the same fate. Maybe we&nbsp;should start investing in&nbsp;some asteroid insurance...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d95/103/05c8a2522d82997549309714b8.png><p>But trust&nbsp;me, the Red Planet isn’t mean at&nbsp;all. It’s actually pretty friendly. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>While Mars seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pretty tough for Phobos, there’s something that might be&nbsp;thriving with Mars’ help</a>. So, get this&nbsp;— a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;scientists found a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;grow <a href=# title=rice data-link=tag>rice</a> on&nbsp;Mars! Yeah, you heard me&nbsp;right. They used MMS&nbsp;— not the outdated way to&nbsp;send pictures, but a&nbsp;special soil called Mojave Mars Simulant. It’s supposed to&nbsp;mimic Martian soil.</p><p>But here’s the catch&nbsp;— Martian soil has these nasty perchlorate salts that can be&nbsp;toxic for plants. So, the team grew three types of&nbsp;rice&nbsp;— one normal and two gene-edited with mutations that make them better at&nbsp;handling stress like drought or&nbsp;salinity. And guess what? The mutant strains were able to&nbsp;root in&nbsp;soil with one gram of&nbsp;perchlorate per kilogram! Take that, Martian soil!</p><p>But hold&nbsp;up. The rice grown in&nbsp;the MMS didn’t turn out as&nbsp;great as&nbsp;the ones grown in&nbsp;regular potting soil. So, the team decided to&nbsp;mix a&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;potting soil with the Martian simulant, and look there! The plants started developing better. Now, these scientists aren’t just thinking about feeding Martians. They also want to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;their findings can help grow crops in&nbsp;places on&nbsp;Earth with high salinity.</p><p>And get this&nbsp;— the whole project started when two researchers met for coffee and decided to&nbsp;try growing plants together. Well isn’t that nice? I&nbsp;suspect you’re about to&nbsp;say: “Hey, but if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;grow rice on&nbsp;Mars, you have to&nbsp;ship insane amounts of&nbsp;water from Earth, as&nbsp;it’s not easy to&nbsp;quench this plant’s thirst!” You’re right, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>you need about four hundred forty-nine gallons of&nbsp;water to&nbsp;only grow a&nbsp;pound of&nbsp;rice</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1b3/e02/b3faf45326b87bb1dd41481ed9.png><p>But guess what? Scientists just made a&nbsp;groundbreaking announcement at&nbsp;the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in&nbsp;Texas&nbsp;— <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>they found a&nbsp;relict glacier near Mars’ equator</a>! That’s right, water ice on&nbsp;Mars, even near the equator! This is&nbsp;huge news and could mean that there’s even more ice just below the surface. It’s not just any glacier, it’s a&nbsp;relict glacier that’s estimated to&nbsp;be&nbsp;three point five miles long and up&nbsp;to&nbsp;two point five miles wide. That’s like the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small town!</p><p>It’s got all the features of&nbsp;a&nbsp;glacier, including crevasse fields and moraine bands. But get this&nbsp;— it’s not actually ice, it’s a&nbsp;salt deposit that formed on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the glacier while preserving its shape. So&nbsp;how did this salt deposit form?</p><p>Well, it&nbsp;turns out that volcanic materials blanketing the region might have something to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;it. When these materials come in&nbsp;contact with water ice, sulfate salts may form and build up&nbsp;into a&nbsp;hardened, crusty layer. Over time, erosion removed the volcanic materials, exposing the sulfates and revealing the glacier’s unique features.</p><p>This glacier is&nbsp;young, likely from the Amazonian geologic period. That means that Mars has had surface ice in&nbsp;recent times. Who knows what other icy secrets Mars is&nbsp;hiding? But hold your horses, there’s still more research to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done. Scientists need to&nbsp;figure out if&nbsp;there’s still water ice preserved underneath the salt deposit or&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;has disappeared entirely.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3ff/c86/b19c1b534bbb0afabee3864fb2.png><p>And if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;still water ice at&nbsp;shallow depths near the equator, that could have major implications for human exploration. Imagine being able to&nbsp;extract water from the ground at&nbsp;a&nbsp;warmer location&nbsp;— that would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;game-changer!</p><p>So&nbsp;let’s see what else these scientists uncover about our favorite red neighbor. Maybe one day we’ll even get to&nbsp;visit that salt-glacier statue in&nbsp;person! See you next time!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqivtJmoKxloKGur7rIp55mrJ9isaa%2F06umsmWZqcBuu9anZKann6N6eX2Va3BrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./latest-amanda-holden-underwear-pictures-have-become-a-hilarious-meme.html><span>←</span><span>Latest Amanda Holden Underwear Pictures Have Become A Hilarious Meme</span></a>
