The duo was spotted backstage at Gutenberg!

The Musical, shared a snapshot on Instagram featuring the famous “Positions” singer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grande</a>, and Spamalot star Slater. Rannells expressed his joy, captioning the photo with enthusiasm and encouraging others to see Spamalot.</p><p>In the picture, Slater and Grande appeared to be in good spirits, with Slater donning a striped white sweater and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grande</a> in a gray sweater. Josh Gad, in a brown suit with a loosened tie, and Rannells, sporting an argyle sweater, completed the quartet.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Grande has shown her face in a Broadway theater. The pop star was recently seen supporting for Slater in Spamalot at the St. James Theatre. For those who may not know, Grande began her professional career on Broadway in 2008 in the play, 13. Since Grande reportedly moved to New York City with Slater, she’s clearly reunited with her Broadway roots.</p><p>Accompanied by her brother Frankie Grande, the pop star was later seen leaving Spamalot‘s opening night with Doug Middlebrook. Photos from the night show Grande playfully donning a Spamalot crown and also holding a program for the show. Dressed in a knight’s costume, Middlebrook then shared a laugh with Grande as he crowned her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-have-a-common-interest-in-broadway>The Couple Have a Common Interest in Broadway</h2><p>The connection between Grande and Slater goes beyond their Broadway outing. The two met on the set of the upcoming movie adaptation of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wicked</a>, where Slater is set to play Boq, the love interest of Nessarose, Elphaba’s sister. Boq is infatuated with Glinda, a role played by Grande.</p><p>They reportedly developed a connection offscreen and began dating shortly after Grande’s separation from her husband Dalton Gomez and Slater’s separation from his wife Lilly Jay. Their relationship was first confirmed in October 2023.</p><p>Some sources have alleged that Grande and Slater had an affair while they were both still married, but a close family friend of Grande’s has denied these claims, saying that the couple did not begin seeing each other until after both parties were separated.</p><p>Grande and Slater have kept their relationship relatively low-key, but they have been spotted out together a few times, including at a Disney Park in September 2023. They have also reportedly moved in together in New York City.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_ChanceTheRapper_JenniferHudson-220x147.jpg alt="Chance the Rapper, Jennifer Hudson, Quincy Jones Team Up to Reopen Chicago’s Ramova Theatre" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKugmqaRYrSzrc2dnGadpJ2ur3nSpZitnaJixKa%2BxGanoaekpLSzrc%2BhnJ1lpKS0psDHnqlmpJWWw6q6xmaYZpqipK6lw8CyZKygn6x8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fantasy-franchise-prequels-game-of-thrones-lord-of-the-rings.html><span>←</span><span>Viewer Interest in 'House of the Dragon' vs. 'The Rings of Power'</span></a>
