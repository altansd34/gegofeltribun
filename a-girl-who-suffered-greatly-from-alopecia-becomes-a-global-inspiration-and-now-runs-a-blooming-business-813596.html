But when she was diagnosed with alopecia at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;8, her perspective on&nbsp;life changed completely.</p><p>Alopecia is&nbsp;an&nbsp;autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to&nbsp;attack the hair follicles, which results in&nbsp;severe hair loss. From this condition, Bean has gone bald 4&nbsp;times, yet she admits that she wouldn’t change a&nbsp;thing.</p><p><h2>The woman’s condition taught her many important lessons.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/997/292/e327635aab9c015f409f264aa4.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eee/cb7/6b960853cf86a54c754ad48557.jpg><p>Chloe Bean’s alopecia journey has not been easy. But, as&nbsp;she confessed herself, she’s learned the importance of&nbsp;self-love through her special condition. “Loving who you are and embracing things that are far out of&nbsp;your control makes you unique, powerful, and beautiful,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> the woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/408/6f0/48d2315c4ba683eea635bf3b52.jpg><p>Embracing Bean’s condition wasn’t easy. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, she recalls, “I&nbsp;have been bald 3&nbsp;times in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life now<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>,</a> and&nbsp;I don’t really remember my&nbsp;initial reaction the first time&nbsp;I went bald since&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;young, but what I&nbsp;do remember is&nbsp;feeling like&nbsp;I didn’t belong when&nbsp;I was around people in&nbsp;public or&nbsp;around my&nbsp;friends since&nbsp;I wasn’t like the other girls who had such long, beautiful hair. Instead, I&nbsp;always had to&nbsp;wear hats out in&nbsp;public to&nbsp;try and hide the bald spots that were scattered throughout my&nbsp;hair.”</p><p><h2>Going completely bald inspired the woman to&nbsp;start her own business.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da9/d51/b2a3c55c4f8f08452144012626.jpg><p>Family means everything to&nbsp;Bean. Her cousins <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saw</a> how difficult it&nbsp;was for her growing up&nbsp;at&nbsp;times without hair. So&nbsp;when she recently went bald again, her cousins grew out their own hair and gifted her a&nbsp;wig from her family’s locks.</p><p>This became an&nbsp;inspiration for the woman to&nbsp;start her own business. Today, Chloe Bean owns <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Baldie Bean Beauty</a>, an&nbsp;online platform where she sells wigs and other <a href=# title=accessories data-link=tag>accessories</a> for women who happen to&nbsp;have alopecia.</p><p>The woman has become a&nbsp;global inspiration for those who used to&nbsp;think that going bald meant not being beautiful anymore. Bean has proven that hair loss doesn’t have to&nbsp;break a&nbsp;woman’s spirit and self-confidence.</p><p>Chloe Bean’s story can become a&nbsp;real inspiration for those who seek positivity in&nbsp;different circumstances. Here are 10&nbsp;people who also weren’t afraid to&nbsp;go&nbsp;totally bald and reveal the reasons for their decisions with the world.
