Soon the first two children who would turn the couple into mom and dad arrived.</p><p>They have been parents since 2018 after welcoming and caring for Ian and Lolo. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;year of&nbsp;wait and paperwork, but they finally could meet for the first time to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;meal. “We&nbsp;left with a&nbsp;drawing of&nbsp;a&nbsp;house with the name of&nbsp;the four of&nbsp;us and a&nbsp;photo. Happy and afraid of&nbsp;the task we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;take&nbsp;on, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;family by&nbsp;adoption,” Miriam explains in&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blog</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e6/172/7e3221563b92c86484e27214a6.jpg><p>Courtesy of the family</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;was not an&nbsp;easy task, but a&nbsp;challenge that both accepted without hesitation. Little by&nbsp;little, the four of&nbsp;them got to&nbsp;know each other. There were a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;fights now and then, but that’s something quite natural. It&nbsp;was with <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;patience that, together, they could get through each argument and come out stronger than ever.</p><p>“Sometimes they would get angry, and Ian would tell&nbsp;us that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;ask for another family, and&nbsp;I would explain to&nbsp;him that&nbsp;I also threatened my&nbsp;mother when&nbsp;I was young that&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;leave, but that family stays together forever,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> Miriam. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;usually happens in&nbsp;the twists and turns of&nbsp;life, when everything seemed to&nbsp;fall into place bit by&nbsp;bit, Camila suddenly appeared. Maybe they didn’t know it&nbsp;yet, but the child would bring more happiness and change their lives once more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c7/322/b2ac595eb8b097edccc3b05bb4.jpg><p>Courtesy of the family</p><p>Camila was a&nbsp;student of&nbsp;Miriam’s and suddenly started missing classes. Concerned, Miriam asked what had happened to&nbsp;her, and it&nbsp;was at&nbsp;that moment she discovered that the girl was waiting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;adopted. Without hesitation, Miriam went home and talked to&nbsp;her husband: she wanted Camila to&nbsp;be&nbsp;their fifth family member.</p><p>“Cami was 16&nbsp;years old, and her situation with the family she had previously bonded with didn’t work out; it&nbsp;was very similar to&nbsp;what my&nbsp;other two children had gone through. I&nbsp;told Nestor that she was very good and wanted&nbsp;us to&nbsp;help her,” the mother <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/640/c59/b8ed075806b860d645dde99521.jpg><p>Courtesy of the family</p><p>So&nbsp;again, after much waiting and paperwork, Camila joined the Marchese Coronel family. But this time, it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;longer Miriam and Nestor who had to&nbsp;choose; they shared the responsibility with the rest of&nbsp;the family. The couple says the children’s support was essential, as&nbsp;Ian expressed the importance of&nbsp;adopting Cami because she was older, and it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;more difficult for her to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;family.</p><p>Soon the five of&nbsp;them shared the ups and downs of&nbsp;their decision, but naturally, they weathered the challenges with love and understanding. “Cami talks in&nbsp;the car about her real family, and&nbsp;I ask her if&nbsp;we&nbsp;are the fake ones. She can’t answer&nbsp;me. Today I&nbsp;am not hopeful, but we&nbsp;will have to&nbsp;trust in&nbsp;the process, in&nbsp;time, and we&nbsp;will always be&nbsp;here for her,” Miriam often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f55/045/5227dd500d98d7441fe56a2e90.jpg><p>Courtesy of the family</p><p>Miriam’s thought is&nbsp;valuable and essential because when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;adoption, you can’t think you’re “choosing” a&nbsp;child. Just as&nbsp;you don’t choose who your biological children are, you won’t choose adoptive ones either; when you go&nbsp;through a&nbsp;rough patch, you can’t just “return” them and think that’s the way out. The teaching she leaves&nbsp;us in&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blog</a> is&nbsp;that you must love, respect, and patience should always prevail above all.</p><p>Today, Miriam accompanies families in&nbsp;adoptive parenting workshops because she understands that there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;magic recipe to&nbsp;make things work for everyone. We&nbsp;all have problems, but we&nbsp;must face them. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;proven that the love of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child can blossom anywhere, regardless of&nbsp;external factors such as&nbsp;origin or&nbsp;age. The Marchese Coronel family is&nbsp;also living proof of&nbsp;this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c6/729/5a39a35e6eb8edccd612e13372.jpg><p>Courtesy of the family</p><p>What is&nbsp;the most important value or&nbsp;rule to&nbsp;respect in&nbsp;your home?
