The couple celebrated the arrival of&nbsp;their baby, Phoenix Barron Hilton Reum, born via a&nbsp;surrogate on&nbsp;January&nbsp;16, 2023. The couple decided to&nbsp;venture into parenthood when Paris’s typically hectic schedule of&nbsp;traveling <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>250 days</a> a&nbsp;year slowed down, giving the newlyweds a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;plan their family.</p><p><h2>Paris kept the baby’s arrival under wraps at&nbsp;first.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3af/c6b/93e75e598080b6304f7471876f.jpg><p>The couple, who tied the knot in&nbsp;late <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2021</a>, kept the <a href=# title=news data-link=tag>news</a> of&nbsp;their baby’s arrival under wraps for over a&nbsp;week. She donned a&nbsp;brunette wig and used an&nbsp;alias when arriving at&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a> to&nbsp;avoid media attention. In&nbsp;fact, she even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hid</a> the news from her mother Kathy Hilton. Paris finally announced Phoenix’s birth on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> eight days after the special day. She revealed that she always wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother and is&nbsp;grateful she met her husband at&nbsp;the right time.</p><p>Paris couldn’t contain her joy when talking about her baby on&nbsp;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. She affectionately described Phoenix as&nbsp;an&nbsp;angel, saying, “He&nbsp;is&nbsp;such an&nbsp;angel, he’s the best. I’m just so&nbsp;obsessed with him; I&nbsp;feel my&nbsp;heart is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;explode.”</p><p><h2>Her latest photos have sparked a&nbsp;concern.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c7/6aa/e40f1b5a74954b8dac72bae029.jpg><p>Paris let fans have a&nbsp;glimpse of&nbsp;her nine month old baby boy and shared a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;photos, captioning “My&nbsp;precious angel baby Phoenix’s first time in&nbsp;NYC.” Comments poured&nbsp;in, and fans couldn’t help but notice how cute Phoenix is.</p><p>But, some fans also expressed their concerns about the baby’s health. “He&nbsp;really does look like he&nbsp;has macrocephaly! My&nbsp;boys all had big heads, but his is&nbsp;much larger. And yes I’m a&nbsp;nurse,” pointed out a&nbsp;person. “You need to&nbsp;have your baby evaluated by&nbsp;a&nbsp;pediatric neurosurgeon,” requested another.</p><p>However, someone’s health can’t really be&nbsp;judged by&nbsp;a&nbsp;few photos, and Paris and Reum have not commented on&nbsp;it&nbsp;either. But, Paris did point out in&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>podcast</a> that she thinks Phoenix looks like her. Her husband agreed and added that he&nbsp;got chills the first time he&nbsp;saw their baby as&nbsp;he&nbsp;as&nbsp;the same eyes as&nbsp;Paris.</p><p><h2>The meaning behind “Phoenix Barron”.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5b/0c5/db5693539fa428f49c4c6449c5.jpg><p>The name “Phoenix Barron” had been in&nbsp;Paris’s mind for a&nbsp;while. She shared its significance, saying, that just like the bird that rises from the ashes and flies again, she wants her son to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;knowing disasters should not hold him down. Ups and downs go&nbsp;around, and he&nbsp;should feel hopeful for the future. The middle name, “Barron,” was a&nbsp;touching tribute to&nbsp;her late grandfather, Barron Hilton, who had been her mentor.</p><p><h2>Having Phoenix changed Paris’ life forever.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b0/705/2461115e5ea3d08716bb713e4a.jpg><p>When Paris Hilton and Carter Reum brought their baby, Phoenix, home for the first time, they cleverly told their staff that the house needed painting, giving them a&nbsp;precious two days alone with their newborn. She also reveals that she quickly adapted to&nbsp;Phoenix’s sleep schedule. She found joy in&nbsp;singing lullabies to&nbsp;her baby boy, even including her 2006&nbsp;hit, “Stars Are Blind,” the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acoustic</a> version. Paris candidly also shared that she is&nbsp;planning to&nbsp;slow down her career to&nbsp;spend more quality time with her son. She says because of&nbsp;Phoenix, she feels a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;wholeness she never felt before.</p><p><h2>She wants to&nbsp;have lots of&nbsp;more children.</h2></p><p>The 42-year-old, who is&nbsp;not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>afraid</a> to&nbsp;admit that she’s scared of&nbsp;the process of&nbsp;childbirth, revealed that she underwent IVF a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;seven times. Paris got her eggs frozen, on&nbsp;the advice of&nbsp;long-time friend <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian" data-link=tag>Kim Kardashian</a> before she even met Carter. But, together, the couple has frozen 20&nbsp;embryos in&nbsp;hopes of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;large family in&nbsp;the future. Interestingly, all 20&nbsp;of&nbsp;them are boys, Paris confessed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p>After Phoenix, however, Paris and Carter are trying for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>baby girl</a>. Paris has candidly revealed that she went through the procedure again, and she’s waiting for the results to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;possibility of&nbsp;her ever becoming a&nbsp;girl mom.</p><p>Paris also walked the runway during Paris Fashion Week recently which became a&nbsp;hot topic of&nbsp;debate on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=internet data-link=tag>internet</a>.
