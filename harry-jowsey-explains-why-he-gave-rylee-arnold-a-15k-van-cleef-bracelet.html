He initially chose a pearl bracelet but he wasn’t that convinced. Then, he thought of gifting Arnold a black and silver piece but realized that she “doesn’t really wear that.” He thus ended up choosing “the gold one” which retails for $14,600.</p><p>Jowsey went on to explain that his “ego was a little bit hurt” after having three bracelets “on the table.” Hence, he decided to buy all of them and keep the other two for himself.</p><p>On Snapchat, the DWTS alum shared the moment he handed the gift to Arnold, capturing her surprised reaction.</p><p>“Harry! It’s beautiful. Harry!” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rylee</a> squealed. “Oh my gosh, I’m gonna cry. Oh my gosh. It’s stunning!”</p><p>Later, Arnold showed off the bracelet as she got ready. Reflecting on receiving the gift, she said that she’s the “luckiest girl” for having the “most beautiful bracelet I’ve ever seen.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-spent-thanksgiving-with-the-dwts-pro>He Spent Thanksgiving with the DWTS Pro</h2><p>Amid “crazy” dating speculations, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jowsey and Arnold</a> spent Thanksgiving with her family. In an episode of the Lightweights podcast, the DWTS pro explained why the reality star joined them for the holiday.</p><p>“Harry didn’t have any plans for Thanksgiving,” she said. “My family always goes all out for Thanksgiving. All the dinner, all the games. So, I was like, ‘Harry’s got to join. He’s got to have a Thanksgiving this year.’ So, he came along.”</p><p>Since their debut on Dancing With The Stars, the duo has sparked romance rumors. Despite fans’ assumptions though, Jowsey and Arnold have consistently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> the same. However, fans began rethinking if the two are not really dating when Jowsey and Arnold spent some time together during Thanksgiving.</p><p>“He came to my family’s Thanksgiving. They came down to California to do Thanksgiving here so I could be there, and he joined, and it was really fun,” she said. “He had a good time, I think, and all my nieces and nephew love him, so it was really cute.”</p><p>Arnold and Jowsey were eliminated on DWTS during quarterfinals on November 21. Yet, while their stint on the show has ended, Jowsey stated that he and Arnold find time to catch up.</p><p>“We’ve somehow found time every single day to see each other,” he said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_JackBlack_Kevin-Winter_American-Idol-2011_Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Looking Back on Jack Black’s Iconic Performance of “Kiss From A Rose” on ‘American Idol’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x5qpq7Fdn7y4v8SyZJ6woKGuqrrSZq6hsV2dsm6zwK%2BcZqqpobKmecCrpaiklGKubn2UpGSvmZ5isK2xxJ9km6qRmLKtsdNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./former-agt-dancing-duo-stefanny-and-yeeremy-win-spains-got-talent-all-stars.html><span>←</span><span>Former 'AGT' Dancing Duo, Stefanny and Yeeremy, Win 'Spain's Got Talent: All-Stars'</span></a>
