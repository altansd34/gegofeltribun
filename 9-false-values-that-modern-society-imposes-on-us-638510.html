However, in&nbsp;reality, everyone around&nbsp;us turns out to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;our life&nbsp;— parents demand we&nbsp;give them grandchildren, and friends give&nbsp;us advice on&nbsp;opening our own business. At&nbsp;the same time, the manufacturers of&nbsp;various goods want&nbsp;us to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;leopard print skirt and own the latest tech this season. And every other person is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us how we’re supposed to&nbsp;live because “it’s important” or&nbsp;“everybody does&nbsp;it.”</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little shy about discussing this but almost all of&nbsp;us get trapped in&nbsp;these psychological tricks at&nbsp;least once. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, we&nbsp;start to&nbsp;think along these patterns that were intrusively placed into our heads.</p><p><h2>1. “A&nbsp;successful person should have a&nbsp;car, an&nbsp;apartment, and the latest iPhone.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82d/ea1/e0a5de5bd280649d4236a591f0.jpg><p>Today’s society actively promotes life for the sake of&nbsp;pleasure that should be&nbsp;gotten mainly from consuming: purchasing new gadgets, trendy perfumes, or&nbsp;non-stick frying pans. At&nbsp;the same time, they impose on&nbsp;us a&nbsp;model for our children’s behavior who want to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;new toy<strong> right here and right now</strong> (the last 2&nbsp;words are actually a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;most commercial scripts). And it&nbsp;doesn’t matter that once you purchase the latest iPhone you’ll have to&nbsp;eat instant noodles for 6&nbsp;months, and that an&nbsp;expensive car will mostly sit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;garage because its owner won’t have enough money for its service.</p><p><h2>2. “Why should I&nbsp;be inferior to&nbsp;a&nbsp;celebrity?”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb8/5b8/00286d507287eb2ddc4243d94b.jpg><p>Today, psychologists outline this phenomenon as&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>imitation</a> of&nbsp;other social groups’ lifestyles. In&nbsp;other words, these are attempts to&nbsp;imitate&nbsp;TV stars and business people who have the money to&nbsp;finance their impulses.</p><p>But a&nbsp;girl from a&nbsp;rural town or&nbsp;suburb will probably not have enough money for a&nbsp;real <i>haute couture</i> dress, a&nbsp;vacation in&nbsp;the Maldives, or&nbsp;breast augmentation at&nbsp;an&nbsp;expensive Swiss clinic. The problem lies in&nbsp;the fact that she will subconsciously consider herself inferior to&nbsp;some diva from a&nbsp;magazine cover and develop an&nbsp;inferiority complex as&nbsp;she gets older.</p><p><h2>3. “I&nbsp;can’t live without Instagram”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60c/017/8afff8506fa7c3eda6d3ea33c6.jpg><p>The situation is&nbsp;quite simple here&nbsp;— the more beautiful photos you have on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, the more successful and simply better your life seems. At&nbsp;least that’s what people who didn’t take a&nbsp;vacation abroad this summer or&nbsp;don’t have enough money for an&nbsp;expensive restaurant will think.</p><p>Psychologists have <a href=#>another opinion</a> on&nbsp;that: they believe that people who love to&nbsp;show off their life have developing narcissistic features, while the visitors to&nbsp;their accounts may start suffering from envy and even sink into a&nbsp;depression.</p><p><h2>4. “I’m trying my&nbsp;best to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good mom.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/112/1d6/e2d84e50f1bc892e3f121d6e66.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you are not tired, you are not a&nbsp;good mother. That’s the life motto many women adopt after having a&nbsp;baby. Especially if&nbsp;they love to&nbsp;look through glamour magazines where tons of&nbsp;recommendations on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;raise children are outlined.</p><p>However, these perfect mothers often end up&nbsp;not having any time for themselves. Psychologists and <a href=# title=teachers data-link=tag>teachers</a> are already feeling <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>alarmed</a> by&nbsp;this, outlining that due to&nbsp;parents today being so&nbsp;overprotective, kids of&nbsp;this generation are not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;make decisions independently or&nbsp;concentrate on&nbsp;their studies.</p><p><h2>5. “It’s shameful to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;cook or&nbsp;a&nbsp;seamstress.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/88c/564/75681f5fe9a592f2ba871235ec.jpg><p>Over the years, our society has <a href=#>formed</a> the idea that a&nbsp;person without a&nbsp;higher education belongs to&nbsp;a&nbsp;“lower caste” while obtaining a&nbsp;diploma automatically makes them a&nbsp;perfect specialist for whom the doors of&nbsp;all prestigious companies are open.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, we&nbsp;almost completely lost respect for simple work. There are hardly any pupils today who can openly declare that they want to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;seamstress or&nbsp;an&nbsp;electrician. Additionally, if&nbsp;you were born into a&nbsp;family doctors, then you shouldn’t even let the thought of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;barber into your head.</p><p><h2>6. “Bring me&nbsp;my&nbsp;first million.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/731/c5e/309dca5613ac30758fee592658.jpg><p>Many of&nbsp;us are not ready to&nbsp;slowly climb the career ladder and gain the reputation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;seasoned specialist. It’s much easier to&nbsp;attend one of&nbsp;the popular training where people will talk about how bad it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;work for someone and will advise you to&nbsp;escape your office work to&nbsp;finally get the freedom you deserve.</p><p>Because of&nbsp;the desire for quick success imposed by&nbsp;society, people are never going to&nbsp;become professionals in&nbsp;their business. They shift from one job to&nbsp;another hoping that somewhere they will finally get honored and make enormous money without much experience.</p><p><h2>7. “2&nbsp;hours in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the mirror and your natural makeup is&nbsp;ready...”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/988/c72/7dc3e8554bb02d614aed1e4c7f.jpg><p>Modern women have turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;between 2&nbsp;fires. From one side, it’s a&nbsp;<a href=# title="natural beauty" data-link=tag>natural beauty</a> that is&nbsp;trendy right now and that requires very few cosmetics. On&nbsp;the other hand, it’s said that being beautiful means being aware of&nbsp;the latest trends and being able to&nbsp;apply <a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a> at&nbsp;the level of&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional makeup artist.</p><p>That’s why more and more women have been rejecting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the tyranny of&nbsp;makeup</a> lately, not feeling shy about their natural beauty, and saving their precious time by&nbsp;not spending hours in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the mirror.</p><p><h2>8. “Where did you go&nbsp;this year?”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1bc/5e4/b0382352599456ed306a808ab4.jpg><p>How embarrassing is&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;say that you didn’t go&nbsp;anywhere? Or&nbsp;that you’ve spent your vacation in&nbsp;Italy for the 5th time in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row. Or&nbsp;that you booked an&nbsp;all-inclusive package at&nbsp;a&nbsp;Turkish hotel again and rolled from the beach to&nbsp;the buffet for 2&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>All this happens due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;unexpectedly raised trend in&nbsp;traveling and an&nbsp;unspoken competition about who has visited more countries. A&nbsp;vacation in&nbsp;India, a&nbsp;weekend in&nbsp;France, a&nbsp;business trip in&nbsp;the Maldives&nbsp;— all this is&nbsp;to&nbsp;get the maximum amount of&nbsp;likes and to&nbsp;post beautiful photos on&nbsp;Instagram.</p><p><h2>9. “The main thing is&nbsp;your comfort. Other people’s problems don’t relate to&nbsp;you.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ee0/f75/e57bce572c80bb9c52d2011f34.jpg><p>Imagine that you slipped on&nbsp;an&nbsp;icy road, fell right in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;busy street, and injured your arm. Now try to&nbsp;guess how the bystanders will react. In&nbsp;the best-case scenario, they will just pass you&nbsp;by, in&nbsp;the worst&nbsp;— they will be&nbsp;secretly (or&nbsp;not) taking videos of&nbsp;you. And the person who decides to&nbsp;help you will get side glances from people wondering why they got into it&nbsp;and whether they are ready to&nbsp;waste their precious time on&nbsp;this person.</p><p>It&nbsp;might seem that there is&nbsp;nothing more simple and more natural than giving a&nbsp;helping hand to&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who needs&nbsp;it, but the times of&nbsp;responsive people are over and have been overtaken by&nbsp;the trend of&nbsp;people being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>indifferent</a> to&nbsp;their surroundings.</p><p>Are you ready to&nbsp;go&nbsp;against the opinion of&nbsp;the majority?
