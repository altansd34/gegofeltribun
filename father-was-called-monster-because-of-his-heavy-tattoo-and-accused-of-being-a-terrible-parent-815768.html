Despite being parents to&nbsp;seven children and leading a&nbsp;typical family life, they are often targeted with online ridicule because of&nbsp;Richard’s extensive tattoo coverage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ace/344/342b8259dfb1ab88f4bde8cc77.jpg><p>Richard’s journey into tattoos began at&nbsp;17&nbsp;with his first piece of&nbsp;ink. “It&nbsp;became an&nbsp;addiction, I&nbsp;started with my&nbsp;legs and worked my&nbsp;way&nbsp;up,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>. Today, approximately&nbsp;85% of&nbsp;his body is&nbsp;adorned with tattoos featuring the names of&nbsp;his children and even his daughter’s lips.</p><p>“I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;100% covered in&nbsp;tattoos probably within the next four years,” Richard <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>. “I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;it’s the <a href=# title=pain data-link=tag>pain</a> or&nbsp;the artwork you put on&nbsp;you, but it&nbsp;just becomes fascinating when you’re able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this,” he&nbsp;added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6ed/0f4/1b5d715de893ecf3eb1bf25889.png><p><h2>His tattoos have resulted in&nbsp;his children’s friends calling him “scary”.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fde/74d/5d09b85807a0750f266f560a2b.jpg><p>While Richard’s deep passion for tattoos has its downsides, it’s not without its challenges. He&nbsp;shared that children at&nbsp;his kids’ school would frequently become apprehensive around him. His daughter once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disclosed</a>, “They say, ‘ah, it’s a&nbsp;bit scary,’ and I&nbsp;say, ‘no, my&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;not scary, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;good with tattoos.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/691/c3f/bf0fa95f989b5dc617d98a5fec.jpg><p>Richard’s wife, Marita, admitted that she too had reservations about his appearance initially, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;did judge Richard based on&nbsp;his looks at&nbsp;first, but as&nbsp;I got to&nbsp;know him a&nbsp;little bit, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;big-hearted person.”</p><p>Some people also question Marita’s decision to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with Richard, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asking</a>, “How could you choose ’a monster’ to&nbsp;be&nbsp;your child’s father?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/816/f5a/bf5a9451de99f7c9c33503dabc.jpg><p>Despite the adverse reactions to&nbsp;his appearance, Richard remains unwavering as&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving father to&nbsp;his children. “I&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;the PTA, I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;all my&nbsp;kids’ functions,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. Online critics have been unkind about Richard’s choices, with one remarking, “I’m not against tattoos, but&nbsp;I mean honestly, does he&nbsp;really need tattoos on&nbsp;his face like that?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/134/0ed/4a4f32501891931db37151dbef.jpg><p>However, numerous individuals have rallied to&nbsp;Richard’s support, with one commentator asserting, “Everyone keeps talking about his face tattoo. He&nbsp;likes&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;got&nbsp;it. He’s a&nbsp;good father. Let him&nbsp;be.” Another commenter pointed out that his tattoos have no&nbsp;bearing on&nbsp;his ability to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good parent, “Just because someone has tattoos, doesn’t mean they’re a&nbsp;bad parent.”</p><p><h2>Richard forges ahead despite criticism.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/190/b5b/d1a3ec5bdeb67cadec45038044.jpg><p>Richard believes that what people say about others reflects their true character. And he&nbsp;will keep doing what makes him happy. “This is&nbsp;what we&nbsp;did, and we’re happy. We’ve been together six years, our kids are happy, and to&nbsp;us, that’s all that matters,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Richard acknowledges that while the hurtful comments online can be&nbsp;excessive, they do&nbsp;not alter his deep love and dedication to&nbsp;his family. “Having tattoos does not scare my&nbsp;children, it&nbsp;does not make me&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad father, it&nbsp;makes my&nbsp;kids get a&nbsp;different perspective on&nbsp;life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/494/23b/2da65b5b758716fe034818533f.jpg><p>Whether heavily tattooed or&nbsp;not, the reality is&nbsp;that we&nbsp;have the <a href=# title=freedom data-link=tag>freedom</a> to&nbsp;choose how we&nbsp;present ourselves to&nbsp;others. Richard is&nbsp;not alone in&nbsp;his choice to&nbsp;proudly display tattoos on&nbsp;his body.
