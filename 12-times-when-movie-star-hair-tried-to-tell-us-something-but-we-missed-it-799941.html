For example, Rachel from Friends whose hairstyle is&nbsp;still popular, even though it’s <a href=#>been</a> more than 15&nbsp;years since the show ended. The hair of&nbsp;characters can not only start a&nbsp;new fashion trend, but also be&nbsp;symbolic and have a&nbsp;hidden message.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;find out which characters had hairstyles with a&nbsp;meaning behind them. And in&nbsp;the bonus section, you will learn why women almost always have short hair in&nbsp;space movies.</p><p><h2>Clementine Kruczynski (Eternal Sunshine of&nbsp;the Spotless Mind)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb9/768/3823755ea98b00452eac7395a0.jpg><p>The hair of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a>’s character changes all the time throughout the film, which symbolizes her impulsive and changeable nature. But her hair also has a&nbsp;<a href=#>purpose</a>: it&nbsp;helps&nbsp;us understand the chronological order of&nbsp;the events better. Every color of&nbsp;Clementine’s hair is&nbsp;a&nbsp;different period of&nbsp;time and status of&nbsp;her relationship with Joel. When her hair is&nbsp;blue, it’s the present time, after the characters broke&nbsp;up. Red symbolizes Clementine from Joel’s fantasies. Light-orange hair is&nbsp;the crisis in&nbsp;their relationship. And green is&nbsp;the memory of&nbsp;first meeting her.</p><p><h2>Harley Quinn (Suicide Squad and Birds of&nbsp;Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of&nbsp;One Harley Quinn)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d0/062/be2c21565b98adc383eafd9cb8.jpg><p>Harley Quinn’s hair is&nbsp;a&nbsp;direct reflection of&nbsp;her personality. The <a href=#>ponytails</a> show that even though the character is&nbsp;a&nbsp;villain, she’s still childish. The different colors of&nbsp;hair show the duality of&nbsp;her character and the bipolar nature of&nbsp;her relationship with Joker. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;spin-off film, we&nbsp;see <a href=# title="Margot Robbie" data-link=tag>Margot Robbie</a> with shorter hair which means that a&nbsp;new chapter of&nbsp;her life started after the end of&nbsp;her toxic relationship.</p><p><h2>Eleven (Stranger Things)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57c/f19/9296f65d0da8939b490915f1b8.jpg><p>Millie Bobby Brown’s hairstyles have changed the most in&nbsp;3&nbsp;seasons of&nbsp;the series compared to&nbsp;the looks of&nbsp;other characters. When the viewers first met Eleven, she had a&nbsp;shaved head, she was very reserved, and she tried to&nbsp;control her superpowers. In&nbsp;season&nbsp;2, she’s trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal teenager, and she has longer hair, so&nbsp;she’s not much different from other kids.</p><p>In&nbsp;season 3, Eleven’s hair is&nbsp;even longer, to&nbsp;show how much time it’s been since season 2. The stylist of&nbsp;the series, Sarah Hindsgaul, decided to&nbsp;lighten a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;Eleven’s locks to&nbsp;show that it&nbsp;was summer and Eleven had spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time outside. Also, Max’s look <a href=#>inspired</a> Eleven to&nbsp;look like her because they became friends.</p><p><h2>Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4dc/28e/9a636b592982d2dee0acade824.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the movie develops, the main character’s hair changes. He&nbsp;had an&nbsp;ordinary hairstyle that was replaced by&nbsp;a&nbsp;mohawk, which shows the dualism of&nbsp;his character. But there’s also a&nbsp;deeper meaning. The actor and friend of&nbsp;Martin Scorsese, Victor Magnotta, told the director that soldiers in&nbsp;Vietnam often had <a href=#>mohawks</a> done before an&nbsp;important mission, which meant that it&nbsp;was better to&nbsp;not mess with them. This is&nbsp;what the character of&nbsp;Robert De&nbsp;Niro did because he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Vietnam veteran.</p><p><h2>Vivian Ward (Pretty Woman)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/94d/5d5/8814c05d91aaf79763c3cff5ae.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the film, <a href=# title="Julia Roberts" data-link=tag>Julia Roberts</a> is&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;platinum-colored <a href=#>wig</a> which doesn’t look good with her face and is&nbsp;overall messy and vulgar. But soon, we&nbsp;get to&nbsp;see Vivian as&nbsp;she is&nbsp;— with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;red hair, which also shows the transformation of&nbsp;her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman and a&nbsp;new part of&nbsp;her life.</p><p><h2>Sansa Stark (Game of&nbsp;Thrones)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e3/54c/c62f105eb69c82610c364f6c19.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Sansa’s hair, you can often see <a href=#>references</a> to&nbsp;other characters of&nbsp;the series. Like in&nbsp;season&nbsp;3, her hairstyles were inspired by&nbsp;Margaery Tyrell, in&nbsp;season&nbsp;7, she has a&nbsp;braid, like her mother Catelyn. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the series, she let her hair down which is&nbsp;the last and most important message: she is&nbsp;independent.</p><p><h2>Marie-Antoinette (Marie-Antoinette)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab6/007/6e749850a0bbf7ef714f95133e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this Sofia Coppola film, it’s <a href=#>hard</a> to&nbsp;look away from the clothes and looks of&nbsp;the main and supporting characters. They are all very detailed and well-thought-out. And when we&nbsp;found out that the wigs with feathers were the exact copies of&nbsp;those the Queen actually wore, we&nbsp;were stunned. The creators of&nbsp;the film also didn’t forget that Marie-Antoinette really loved powdered wigs. She used <a href=#>flour</a> to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;her wigs&nbsp;— during times when many French people had nothing to&nbsp;eat, which gives&nbsp;us an&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;her character and attitude toward “mere mortals.”</p><p><h2>Sandy Olsson (Grease)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e5d/658/4a74925a22917cea97c4a1e866.jpg><p>After the film Grease was released, Sandy’s hairstyle became the biggest trend among the young people of&nbsp;the ’70s. The new look of&nbsp;the main character symbolized a&nbsp;new page in&nbsp;her life and her transformation from a&nbsp;good girl into a&nbsp;rebel.</p><p><h2>Thor (Marvel Universe)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da1/b1d/94188b5026ae478181229ddb09.jpg><p>In&nbsp;every new Marvel film with Thor, viewers see the acrimony, arguments, and competition between Thor and Loki. Small <a href=#>details</a> show the true relationship between the brothers. So, in&nbsp;Thor: The Dark World and Thor: Ragnarok when Thor was sure that Loki was dead, you could see a&nbsp;black lock in&nbsp;his blonde hair. The lock belonged to&nbsp;his brother. It&nbsp;was probably Thor’s way of&nbsp;dealing with the loss.</p><p><h2>Jordan O’Neil (G.I. Jane) and Fantine (Les Misérables)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3bb/f17/5ff6645ca0b5de94c2d2f872ef.jpg><p>These iconic movies are a&nbsp;clear demonstration of&nbsp;how different the message of&nbsp;short women’s hair can&nbsp;be. For Demi Moore’s character, shaving her hair was <a href=#>a&nbsp;way</a> to&nbsp;show her courage and prove that women can be&nbsp;successful in&nbsp;areas mostly dominated by&nbsp;men. But Fantine’s short hair was a&nbsp;<a href=#>symbol</a> of&nbsp;humiliation, degradation, and the loss of&nbsp;her identity.</p><p><h2>Michael Rezendes (Spotlight)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb1/3a5/0a4d1850fbbb172cef47aa2026.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the plot of&nbsp;the film moves forward, you can see that Michael Rezendes’ hair turns <a href=#>grey</a>. It&nbsp;was the creators’ way of&nbsp;showing how stressful his job is&nbsp;and how seriously he&nbsp;takes&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Women and gravity</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/529/629/1aba285396bf820dc97a05a82e.jpg><p>Maybe you haven’t noticed, but in&nbsp;space movies (or&nbsp;movies where characters have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something in&nbsp;zero gravity) women <a href=#>often</a> appear on&nbsp;the screen with short hair. The thing&nbsp;is, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite hard to&nbsp;portray the way hair would float in&nbsp;zero gravity and it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;too expensive to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you pay attention to&nbsp;the hair of&nbsp;movie and&nbsp;TV series characters?
