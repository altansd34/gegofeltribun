All Rights Reserved.</span><p class=reading-time>Reading Time: 3 minutes</p><p><strong>In the history of the entire <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul’s Drag Race franchise</a>, so many ambitious queens have tried to impersonate <strong>Beyoncé</strong>. All of them have been absolute flops until now. RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars standout Trinity K. Bonet has finally broken the Beyoncé&nbsp;curse.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trinity-k-bonet-breaks-the-beyonc-curse-on-rupaul-s-drag-race-all-stars>Trinity K. Bonet Breaks the <strong><strong>Beyoncé</strong></strong> Curse on ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars’</h2><p>Before Trinity completely bodied her Beyoncé impression this week, the queens took a crack at Jan in the Werk Room. Jan was a bit disgruntled after landing in the bottom <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">last week.</a> It is clear in this season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars that Jan is being painted as the emotional whiner. Fans know that Jan might actually be the dark horse in the competition.</p><p>“I’m about to unleash all the wrath that I have in me so everybody better watch out,” Jan said before this week’s challenge.</p><p>RuPaul challenged the queens to perform a Hall of Fame Halftime Show. The big twist here is that the contestants had to portray Super Bowl halftime icons of their choosing. It would honestly be a crime if nobody chose to do Beyoncé since her halftime show was iconic.</p><p>Trinity stepped up to the plate knowing that Queen B has never successfully been impersonated on the show. And in case you need to hear it again, every portrayal of Beyoncé thus far has been an absolute trainwreck. Don’t even get us started on The Vixen’s Blue Ivy impersonation in Season 10. The Bey Hive has been ready for a queen to do Beyoncé justice on the show for a long time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-keria-c-davenport-takes-one-huge-risk>A’keria C. Davenport Takes One Huge Risk</h2><p>A’keria C. Davenport <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took a bit of a risk</a> deciding to portray <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Prince</a>. Prince had very specific mannerisms and swagger that had to be perfectly embodied. On the flip side, Pandora Boxx played it safe by choosing to perform as Carol Channing, the first-ever Super Bowl halftime entertainer. She already took on this role during Snatch Game in Season 2 of RuPaul’s Drag Race. Yara Sofia also went for a predictable option with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shakira.</a></p><p>Trinity nailed Jamal Sims’ choreography in rehearsal and it became so obvious that it was going to be a battle between her and Jan for the win this week. When it came time for the queens to actually perform, Yara as Shakira was a hot mess. It seemed like she was in her head about memorizing the song lyrics. The choreography was great, but the judges wanted more.</p><p>Jan was feeling very confident with her choice of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Lady Gaga.</a> She literally gave the performance everything that she had. It felt like we were actually watching Lady Gaga perform. A’keria really did not deliver Prince like Jamal wanted her to. All of the queens were just the opening act for the grand finale, Trinity as Beyoncé. She hit every move like a boss and looked stunning. She even nailed all of Beyoncé’s signature hair flipping moments.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-week-s-lip-sync-is-a-total-let-down>This Week’s Lip-Sync is a Total Let Down</h2><p>After the queens strutted their stuff in the Frill of it All&nbsp;runway, Jan was declared the winner of the challenge. Even though Trinity didn’t win, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> declared her to be the de facto winner. She totally broke the Beyoncé curse with flying colors and set a new standard for impersonations on the show. Yara and A’keria were in the bottom.&nbsp;</p><p>Yara’s attitude backstage was very flustered. She agreed that her face wasn’t there during the performance. She also did not plead her case at all which made it feel like she was giving up. When it came time for the lip-sync, Jan was put head to head against this week’s lip-sync assassin, Jessica Wild.</p><p>Jan stood no chance against Jessica lip-synching to “Womanizer” by Britney Spears.&nbsp;Like seriously where was all of the theater queen energy that we were all expecting from Jan? Jessica won the lip-sync with flying colors and revealed that the group decided to send Yara home. Upon leaving the stage Yara shouted, “f*ck you all.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NUP_193480_8705.jpg alt="Legendary Voice Actor Michael Winslow Auditions for ‘America’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZpqVrryvr8Rmmq6qo5p6qr%2BMn6CnmZyhxm6u0aiinqZdpLtuvtSpmK6ko2Kxs63GZqmam5Virq24jKyrmqqjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1607750-stephen-curry-magic-johnson-comparing-point-guards-nba-history.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen Curry vs. Magic Johnson: Comparing Two Best Point Guards in NBA History</span></a>
