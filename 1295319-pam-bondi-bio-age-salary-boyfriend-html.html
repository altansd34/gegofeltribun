Pamela was then admitted to the Florida legal bar on 24th June 1991.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Before she was known as Attorney General Pam Bondi, she worked as a prosecutor, a spokeswoman of Hillsborough County in the State of Florida and also as an Assistant State Attorney. Pamela later resigned from this position in favour of running for the Attorney General seat of Florida.</p><p class=align-left>Pam was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">elected into office</a> on 2nd November 2010, beating out her opposition, Democratic party flag bearer Dan Gelber. She was sworn into office in January 2011 and made history by becoming Florida's first female attorney general. Bondi won the seat again in the 4th November 2014 elections. Pamela Jo served two terms in office and finally stepped down in 2019 as her time had ended.

Another high profile mark in her career is her fight against ObamaCare. She was among the most outspoken Republicans who shunned the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</p><p class=align-left>In 2016, rumours surfaced that the Attorney General had received a $25,000 bribe from President Trump. In a case filed by Boston lawyer J. Whitfield Larrabee, it was alleged Bondi personally asked for the money masked as a donation to Pam's 2013 election campaign. The money in question was to coax Bondi to cancel her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">investigation into Trump University</a> over fraud allegations.</p><p class=align-left>Both parties vehemently denied these allegations, and in early 2017, a Florida prosecutor, through Stephen Russell's state AG office, concluded the case by stating that they could not find <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">enough evidence</a> to prompt a criminal case against Pamela Jo.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/52ccf068151ab084.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rebecca Olson Gupta biography: Who is Sanjay Gupta's wife?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite these corruption allegations, she was nevertheless appointed to the Florida Constitution Revision Commission, a commission that as in-charge of the review and changes of the Florida Constitution. In January 2019, Pam joined the private sector after taking a job with lobbying and PR firm, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ballard Partners</a>.
