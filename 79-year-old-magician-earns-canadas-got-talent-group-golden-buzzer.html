The episode featured a performance from 79-year-old magician Mark Lewis, who earned the group Golden Buzzer. There were also a few recognizable faces among this week’s auditioners.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-79-year-old-magician-earns-cgt-group-golden-buzzer>79-Year-Old Magician Earns CGT Group Golden Buzzer</h2><p>Before his audition, Mark Lewis made the judges laugh with his funny personality. When asked what he’d do with the million-dollar prize, courtesy of Rogers, Mark joked, “What am I gonna do with a million dollars at my age? I’ll be dead.”</p><p>He proceeded to share a card trick with the panel, wowing them with his ability to choose the correct cards and even seem to change cards into other cards without them seeing. Howie Mandel called Mark “such a great, loveable character.”</p><p>When it came time to vote, all four judges voted yes to sending Mark through to the next round. After Mark left, Mandel talked with his fellow judges, and they asked Mark to come back out. Mandel read a funny email Mark sent to producers, and then he asked host Lindsay Ell to join them in hitting the Golden Buzzer for the magician.</p><p>In addition to moving straight to the next round, Mark won $25,000 courtesy of CIBC for earning the group Golden Buzzer. Mark joked that he “nearly had a heart attack” when the confetti rained down.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daniel-powter-auditions-with-his-hit-song-bad-day>Daniel Powter Auditions with His Hit Song ‘Bad Day’</h2><p>During Tuesday’s show, singer Daniel Powter took the stage to audition. You might recognize Daniel for his song “Bad Day,” which was a chart-topping hit back in 2005. Daniel told the judges he would be singing an original song, but he didn’t tell them what it was.</p><p>The panel was shocked when he started singing “Bad Day.” The audience swayed along and waved their phones in the air as he performed. As Mandel said after the performance, “Now I know who you are.” He added that Daniel “had a good day.”</p><p>Daniel was emotional as he shared that he had traveled the world performing, but it was his first time on TV in his home country of Canada. All four judges voted yes to sending Daniel through to the next round of the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-agt-duo-funkanometry-shows-off-their-moves>AGT Duo Funkanometry Shows Off Their Moves</h2><p>Daniel Powter wasn’t the only familiar face to appear during Tuesday’s new episode of CGT. Fans of America’s Got Talent might recognize dance duo Funkanometry from their time on the show in Season 17. Mandel was excited to see them there.</p><p>The pair showed off a funny dance routine set to “Sweet Home Alabama” by Lynyrd Skynyrd and “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen. Judge Lilly Singh praised their timing, while Mandel said they “check every box.” All four judges voted yes to sending Funkanometry through to the next round.</p><p>What did you think of this week’s performances?
