At&nbsp;just 6&nbsp;or 7&nbsp;years old, she began practicing gymnastics in&nbsp;her hometown. The fateful turn in&nbsp;her life occurred when her former coach, Béla Károlyi, ventured into her school in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;young talents for his gymnastic program.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;moment that would shape her destiny, Károlyi posed a&nbsp;simple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>question</a> to&nbsp;the girls, «Who can do&nbsp;a&nbsp;cartwheel?» Two eager young girls, including Nadia, promptly demonstrated their skills. Impressed, Károlyi initiated a&nbsp;conversation with the girls’ mothers, setting in&nbsp;motion the extraordinary journey of&nbsp;a&nbsp;gymnastics prodigy.</p><p><h2>Nadia was the first with a&nbsp;perfect score.</h2></p><p>Nadia Comăneci <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>secured</a> her place in&nbsp;Olympic history as&nbsp;the pioneering gymnast to&nbsp;achieve a&nbsp;perfect score, a&nbsp;milestone that remains etched in&nbsp;the collective memory. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;13, she showcased her exceptional talents by&nbsp;clinching three gold and one silver medal at&nbsp;the 1975 European Championships in&nbsp;Skien, Norway, earning the esteemed title of ’Athlete of&nbsp;the Year’ from the Associated Press. However, it&nbsp;was her extraordinary performance at&nbsp;the 1976 Olympics that catapulted her into international stardom.</p><p>During her routine on&nbsp;the uneven bars, the 14-year-old Romanian prodigy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>executed</a> a&nbsp;flawless 30-second display, leaving the world in&nbsp;awe. The judges, acknowledging the unparalleled perfection of&nbsp;her routine, awarded her the elusive perfect score of&nbsp;10. This historic moment marked the first instance of&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect 10&nbsp;in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;Olympic gymnastics competitions, with the initial scoreboard confusion reading ’1.00,’ adding an&nbsp;element of&nbsp;suspense and astonishment to&nbsp;Nadia Comăneci’s groundbreaking achievement.</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;18 Nadia Comăneci returned to&nbsp;the Olympics.</h2></p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;18, Nadia Comăneci made a&nbsp;poignant <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>return</a> to&nbsp;the Olympics in&nbsp;1980, marking a&nbsp;significant chapter in&nbsp;her gymnastics career. Returning as&nbsp;a&nbsp;seasoned athlete, she faced the challenges of&nbsp;competing at&nbsp;a&nbsp;more mature level.
