This singer performed her hit “29,” and left fans wondering, ‘who’s Carly Pearce?’</strong></p><p>Pearce recently earned ‘Female Vocalist of The Year’ at the Country Music Awards. Prior to her performance, she spoke on what the new song means to her and what she hopes to portray:</p><p>“When I started writing ’29,’ I was in such a vulnerable and broken space. But feeling the connection with people on their own journeys has reminded us all we’re not alone,” she <a href=#>said</a>. “I couldn’t be more grateful to share ’29’ for my first appearance on The Voice! In a year where my world has completely shifted, I know the value of a show that gives dreamers like me a chance to sing their truth.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CXFg_-Ps3GC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-carly-pearce>Who is Carly Pearce?</h2><p>This singer-songwriter is 31 years old, but began performing music in her teens. Her main genre is country music, but she’s also performed bluegrass music. At 19 years old, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue her singing dreams.</p><p>In 2015, she met Pete Fisher, the vice president and general manager of The Grand Ole Opry at the time. She created a professional relationship with him and was able to perform at The Grand Ole Opry in 2015 before she was signed to a record label. This performance and connection lead the singer to a developing artist deal with producer Michael James Ryan Busbee.</p><p>Her rise to fame was her single “<a href=#>Every Little Thing</a>” that peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in 2017. That hit song helped her secure her deal with Big Machine Records. Since then, she has released four albums, toured with <a href=#>Luke Bryan</a>, Thomas Rhett, and The Voice coach <a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>. She was also invited by Dolly Parton to become a cast member of The Grand Ole Opry.</p><p>For more on Pearce, you can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">catch her</a> on tour this coming April.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NUP_195982_01413.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Recap: Top 5 Announced Ahead of Historic Season 21 Finale" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>carly pearce</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqppbFdpbKivsKeZKaZm5rAbrTEq2SdnZKqwW67zWaroZ1dq7yqr8Rmqq2Zl5p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./company.html><span>←</span><span>Careers - Morning Consult</span></a>
