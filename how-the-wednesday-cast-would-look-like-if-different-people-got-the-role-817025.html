<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>How the Wednesday Cast Would Look Like If Different People Got the Role</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wednesday</i></a> captured the attention of&nbsp;people worldwide and made headlines, becoming instantly popular. It&nbsp;garnered an&nbsp;astounding 1&nbsp;billion hours of&nbsp;viewing in&nbsp;less than a&nbsp;month after its release, after only <i>Squid Game</i> and <i>Stranger Things</i>. The captivating <a href=# title="Tim Burton" data-link=tag>Tim Burton</a>’s spin-off of&nbsp;<i>Addams Family</i> is&nbsp;nominated for two Golden Globes, with Jenna Ortega vying for Best <a href=# title=Actress data-link=tag>Actress</a>. However, despite the original <i>Wednesday</i> cast, many actors stick to&nbsp;the same physical appearance and traits, and we&nbsp;believe that they could have easily adapted to&nbsp;the roles. Can you guess what are our picks?</p><p><h2>1. Wednesday Addams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3fa/98c/ee7beb581697135ce68a7d9b46.jpg><p>Jenna Ortega, became really famous from the show <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wednesday</i></a><i>.</i> She wasn’t sure about taking the role at&nbsp;first, but she did. Before this, she was well-known for being on&nbsp;<a href=# title=TV data-link=tag>TV</a>, especially in&nbsp;a&nbsp;show called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>You</i></a>. She was worried about only doing&nbsp;TV and missing out on&nbsp;doing movies. Ortega has been acting since she was little, in&nbsp;shows like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Jane the Virgin</i></a> and Disney’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Stuck in&nbsp;the Middle</i></a>.</p><p>She’s also been in&nbsp;movies like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Yes Day</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Babysitter: Killer Queen</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Fallout</i></a>. Even before <i>Wednesday</i>, she was in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Scream</i></a> and other movies. For <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Wednesday</a>, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>really</a> got ready by&nbsp;learning the cello, German, and making sure she didn’t blink.</p><p>In&nbsp;the show, there’s a&nbsp;part where she dances to&nbsp;a&nbsp;song called “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Goo Goo Muck</i></a>” at&nbsp;a&nbsp;school dance, and fans loved&nbsp;it.</p><p>Camila Mendes, who’s famous for being in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Riverdale</i></a>, could have been a&nbsp;good choice for the role of&nbsp;Wednesday too. Like Ortega, Mendes is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Latina and has the right look with her black hair for the Addams Family. Even though she’s older, she’s played roles where she had the right attitude and sarcasm, just like Wednesday. She could totally do&nbsp;the deadpan look well.</p><p><h2>2. Enid Sinclair</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fa/34e/a5664f55d69f769533a8ae5cbf.jpg><p>Emma Myers gained swift acclaim in&nbsp;the series <i>Wednesday</i> for her portrayal of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Enid Sinclair</a>, swiftly winning over fans. At&nbsp;only 20, Myers had already showcased her talent in&nbsp;movies like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Girl in&nbsp;the Basement</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Taste of&nbsp;Christmas</i></a> before landing the significant role of&nbsp;Enid.</p><p>Joining the cast of&nbsp;<i>Wednesday</i> marked a&nbsp;pivotal moment for Myers. It&nbsp;was her first experience working among people her own age, offering a&nbsp;new and refreshing dynamic in&nbsp;her acting journey. The filming location in&nbsp;Romania provided a&nbsp;unique opportunity for Myers to&nbsp;forge strong <a href=# title=bonds data-link=tag>bonds</a> with her co-stars, fostering a&nbsp;close-knit relationship that she hadn’t encountered much in&nbsp;her previous acting endeavors.</p><p>Consider a&nbsp;hypothetical scenario where <i>Wednesday</i> was produced in&nbsp;2004. Can you imagine the young version of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Taylor Momsen</a>, known for her role as&nbsp;Jenny Humphrey in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Gossip Girl</i></a>, potentially being an&nbsp;interesting choice for the character of&nbsp;Enid Sinclair? Visualizing Momsen’s physical appearance, particularly her blonde hair, aligns with the essence of&nbsp;Myers’ portrayal in&nbsp;<i>Wednesday</i>. Despite the differences between the characters of&nbsp;Jenny and Enid, Momsen’s ability to&nbsp;tackle intense roles might have complemented the vivacious nature of&nbsp;Enid’s character in&nbsp;the series.</p><p><h2>3. Marilyn Thornhill</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/063/244/65b68e5bb683547c26434f0906.jpg><p>Christina Ricci, came full circle by&nbsp;joining the series. She first played Wednesday when she was 10&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Addams Family</i></a> in&nbsp;1991 and reprised it&nbsp;in&nbsp;1993’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Addams Family Values</i></a>. After ’90s hits like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Casper</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Now and Then</i></a>, she starred in&nbsp;many films, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sleepy Hollow</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Monster</i></a>.</p><p>She also did&nbsp;TV, like ABC’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Pan Am</i></a>&nbsp;and Lifetime’s<i> </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Lizzie Borden Chronicles</i></a>. Now, she’s in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Yellowjackets</i></a>. Ricci, over 30&nbsp;years after her first Wednesday role, returned to&nbsp;the Addams Family as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Marilyn Thornhill</a>, the dorm housemother.</p><p>She passed on&nbsp;the role to&nbsp;Jenna Ortega, thrilled with Ortega’s take. Ricci praised Ortega’s bravery and how she does justice to&nbsp;the role. Ricci cherishes her time as&nbsp;Wednesday but believes it’s now Ortega’s part.</p><p>Apart from her career, Ricci is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mom</a> of&nbsp;two. She has an&nbsp;8-year-old son, Freddie, with her ex-husband. After filing for divorce in&nbsp;2020, she married hairstylist Mark Hampton in&nbsp;2021 and welcomed their daughter Cleopatra later that year.</p><p>Imagine Estella from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Cruella</i></a> stepping into Mrs. Thornhill’s role. They’re both gentle and serene but seem to&nbsp;grapple with borderline personality disorder. They share similar hair color, style, and hairstyles. While their behaviors and stories differ, they could harmonize together effortlessly.</p><p><h2>4. Xavier Thorpe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e98/a20/7101455db7a118aef778d7a80f.jpg><p>Percy Hynes White, takes center stage as&nbsp;the brooding character in&nbsp;the Netflix series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wednesday</i></a>, embodying the role of&nbsp;Nevermore’s introspective and moody <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>guy</a>. Before stepping into this pivotal role, Hynes White showcased his acting prowess in&nbsp;films like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Edge of&nbsp;Winter</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Christmas Horror Story</i></a>. However, it&nbsp;was his portrayal of&nbsp;the mutant Andy Strucker in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Gifted</i></a> that propelled him into the limelight.</p><p>Despite the weight of&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;a&nbsp;major series, Hynes White expressed sheer delight while filming <i>Wednesday</i>. He&nbsp;likened the experience to&nbsp;a&nbsp;big-budget movie, describing it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;joyous occasion filled with camaraderie and fun, akin to&nbsp;hanging out with close friends.</p><p>Excitingly, Hynes White is&nbsp;poised to&nbsp;collaborate once more with his <i>Wednesday</i> co-star, Jenna Ortega, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;upcoming project titled <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Winter Spring Summer or&nbsp;Fall</i></a>. This venture, where Ortega serves as&nbsp;both lead and executive producer, explores the blossoming romance between two teenagers across the span of&nbsp;four days.</p><p>What if&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;scenario where the young version of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tom Felton</a>, known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Draco Malfoy</a> from <a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a>, takes over the role of&nbsp;Xavier Thorpe in&nbsp;the popular series, it&nbsp;could potentially inject a&nbsp;fresh dynamic into the character. Felton’s inherent cunning and aristocratic demeanor might add a&nbsp;layer of&nbsp;sophistication and intrigue, infusing Thorpe’s character with calculated charm and an&nbsp;air of&nbsp;superiority, thereby offering a&nbsp;new depth to&nbsp;Xavier Thorpe’s personality.</p><p><h2>5. Tyler Galpin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a84/69f/54b48c5168aee5b94920dceec9.jpg><p>Hunter Doohan, at&nbsp;29, embodies the character of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tyler Galpin</a> in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wednesday</i></a>. Despite being a&nbsp;regular guy from the neighboring town, Tyler strikes up&nbsp;an&nbsp;unexpected friendship with Wednesday after their chance meeting at&nbsp;the coffee shop where he&nbsp;works. His easygoing and approachable nature forms an&nbsp;intriguing contrast to&nbsp;Wednesday’s darker and more serious demeanor.</p><p>Before securing this role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;potential love interest in&nbsp;Wednesday, Doohan showcased his acting chops in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Your Honor</i></a>, starring alongside Bryan Cranston, and portrayed a&nbsp;younger Aaron Paul in&nbsp;Apple TV+’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Truth Be&nbsp;Told</i></a>.</p><p>Doohan celebrated a&nbsp;significant milestone by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tying</a> the knot with his longtime partner, Fielder Jewett, in&nbsp;June 2022. The cherry on&nbsp;top? Bryan Cranston, who plays Doohan’s on-screen father, actually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>officiated</a> their wedding ceremony!</p><p>When considering an&nbsp;actor who could flawlessly step into Tyler Galpin’s shoes, someone like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Timothée Chalamet</a> comes to&nbsp;mind. Chalamet’s proven ability to&nbsp;breathe life into complex characters with a&nbsp;blend of&nbsp;charm and depth could add a&nbsp;captivating dimension to&nbsp;the character of&nbsp;Tyler in&nbsp;<i>Wednesday</i>.</p><p><h2>6. Morticia Addams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d40/092/87596159919d42941fe4030383.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the <i>Wednesday</i> cast, steps into the role of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Morticia Addams</a>. She began her acting journey in&nbsp;London’s West End, performing in&nbsp;musicals like Annie and Bugsy Malone. Her fame soared with the British TV&nbsp;series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Darling Buds of&nbsp;May</i></a> from 1991 to&nbsp;1993. Later, she made a&nbsp;mark in&nbsp;hit movies like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Mask of&nbsp;Zorro</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Entrapment</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Traffic</i></a>, and won an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Oscar data-link=tag>Oscar</a> for “Chicago” in&nbsp;2002.</p><p>After a&nbsp;break from&nbsp;TV, she returned in&nbsp;2017 for Ryan Murphy’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Feud</i></a> and appeared in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Prodigal Son</i></a> before joining <i>Wednesday.</i> Zeta-Jones told InStyle her aim was to&nbsp;give Morticia a&nbsp;modern twist, showing her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom dealing with everyday challenges with a&nbsp;<a href=# title=supernatural data-link=tag>supernatural</a> edge.</p><p>In&nbsp;real life, she’s a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mom</a> to&nbsp;Carys and Dylan, with her husband, <a href=# title="Michael Douglas" data-link=tag>Michael Douglas</a>. Zeta-Jones appreciates her kids’ support, even noticing similarities between her daughter Carys and the character Wednesday.</p><p>Thinking about the perfect fit for Morticia Addams in&nbsp;<i>Wednesday</i>, an&nbsp;actress like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Eva Green</a> might nail&nbsp;it. Green is&nbsp;known for her mysterious, elegant, and darkly humorous roles, which could bring a&nbsp;captivating essence to&nbsp;Morticia.</p><p><h2>7. Gomez Addams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/662/eb1/a1d850545785c4e6b1becfdd5c.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Luis Guzmán</a>, 67, steps into the role of&nbsp;Gomez, the amiable patriarch in&nbsp;Netflix’s show. Prior to&nbsp;portraying this character, Guzmán gained prominence through his performances in&nbsp;HBO’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Oz</i></a>&nbsp;and acclaimed movies like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Boogie Nights</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Traffic</i></a>, where he&nbsp;previously worked alongside his&nbsp;TV wife, Zeta-Jones.</p><p>Interestingly, Guzmán’s entry into <i>Wednesday </i>was unique. Director Tim Burton personally approached and offered him the role without the need for an&nbsp;audition, a&nbsp;gesture that immediately captivated him. Guzmán highlighted the series’ clever writing during an&nbsp;appearance on&nbsp;The Rich Eisen Show, emphasizing its distinct humor as&nbsp;a&nbsp;compelling factor that drew him&nbsp;in.</p><p>Beyond his on-screen endeavors, Guzmán has sustained a&nbsp;joyful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marriage</a> with Angelita Galarza-Guzmán since 1985, nurturing a&nbsp;family with seven children, showcasing his dedication both on&nbsp;and off the screen.</p><p>When considering a&nbsp;perfect fit for the role of&nbsp;Gomez Addams in&nbsp;<i>Wednesday,</i> an&nbsp;actor capable of&nbsp;blending charisma, charm, a&nbsp;dash of&nbsp;eccentricity, and a&nbsp;deep love for the unusual might be&nbsp;an&nbsp;ideal match. Someone like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oscar Isaac</a>, known for his ability to&nbsp;portray characters with magnetism, depth, and a&nbsp;quirky edge, could bring a&nbsp;captivating and nuanced performance to&nbsp;Gomez Addams.</p><p><h2>8. Pugsley Addams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b48/e5d/fff7605dce9fa6d619ca3dfaff.jpg><p>Fourteen-year-old actor Isaac Ordonez successfully secured the role of&nbsp;Pugsley Addams, Wednesday’s brother, in&nbsp;the Netflix series. His previous credits included appearances in&nbsp;movies like Disney’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Wrinkle in&nbsp;Time</i></a> (2018) and a&nbsp;few indie projects, but it&nbsp;was this particular series that truly marked his breakthrough in&nbsp;the industry. Surprisingly, despite stepping into the shoes of&nbsp;an&nbsp;iconic character, Ordonez revealed to&nbsp;J-14 that he&nbsp;didn’t feel nervous at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Seeking to&nbsp;infuse Pugsley with a&nbsp;unique touch, Ordonez drew inspiration from his on-screen big sister, Jenna Ortega, who portrayed Wednesday with a&nbsp;brilliant balance of&nbsp;seriousness and a&nbsp;hint of&nbsp;comedy. According to&nbsp;Ordonez, Ortega’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>portrayal</a> inspired him to&nbsp;craft Pugsley’s character in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar light.</p><p>When contemplating the ideal actor to&nbsp;portray Pugsley Addams in&nbsp;<i>Wednesday,</i> one might consider someone like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Finn Wolfhard</a>. Renowned for his versatility and adeptness in&nbsp;embodying multifaceted characters with a&nbsp;blend of&nbsp;mischief and depth, Wolfhard holds the potential to&nbsp;bring an&nbsp;even more captivating and intriguing essence to&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;Pugsley Addams.</p><p><h2>9. Bianca Barclay</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ff/d47/b982ee5efda1bea8bf2fcdc733.jpg><p>The 27-year-old star, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Joy Sunday</a>, made her&nbsp;TV debut as&nbsp;a&nbsp;top-of-show guest star on&nbsp;CBS’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>MacGyver</i></a> in&nbsp;2016.<strong> </strong>She landed her SAG card through Justin Simien’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Bad Hair</i></a> in&nbsp;2020, marking her path into the industry.

The clash between a&nbsp;top-tier girl and a&nbsp;newcomer isn’t groundbreaking, but Joy Sunday, the actress behind Bianca, felt thrilled to&nbsp;transform the stereotypical “mean girl” role into something fresh and intriguing.</p><p>In&nbsp;casting the perfect Bianca Barclay for <i>Wednesday,</i> an&nbsp;actress who radiates sophistication, charm, and an&nbsp;air of&nbsp;mystery could be&nbsp;the missing piece. Think of&nbsp;someone like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Zazie Beetz</a>, known for her ability to&nbsp;portray multifaceted characters with elegance and depth, could bring a&nbsp;captivating and intriguing essence to&nbsp;the character in&nbsp;the series.</p><p><h2>10.
