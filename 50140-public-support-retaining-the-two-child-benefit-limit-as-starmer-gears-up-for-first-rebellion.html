Introduced by Conservative chancellor George Osborne in 2015, the policy has been controversial among Labour figures for its link to increased rates of child poverty among affected families, with former prime minister Gordon Brown among those calling for it to be scrapped. Keir Starmer has, however, supported the retaining of the policy, arguing it would not be financially feasible to scrap at the current time.</p><p data-block-key=6vh1o>Regardless of the merits of the policy, the Labour leadership will be reassured that their current pledge of keeping the two-child limit is supported by six in ten Britons (60%), with less than three in ten (28%) believing it should be abolished.</p><p data-block-key=cg34h>There is support for keeping the cap across almost all voting and social groups, including Labour voters, who back it by 50% to 38%. The only exception is among 18-24 year olds, only a third (32%) of whom think the cap should be kept, with nearly half (46%) opposing it. Older voters are far more likely to favour the policy, with 69% of over-65s wanting it to stay and only 21% believing it should be abolished.</p><p data-block-key=et7u1><b>See the full results</b> <a href=#><b>here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=fslft>What do you think about welfare policy, British politics in general, and everything else?
