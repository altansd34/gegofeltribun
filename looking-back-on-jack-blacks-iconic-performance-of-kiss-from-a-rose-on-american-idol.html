Introducing himself to the judges Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>, Black noted he would be singing “Kiss From A Rose,” which he incorrectly attributed to the soundtrack of “the most sensitive of all the Batmans” – Batman Returns from 1992.</p><p>The ballad actually appeared in the following Batman film, 1995’s Batman Forever. Nonetheless, Black powered through the first few lines as the judges looked on stone-faced.</p><p>Channeling Seal’s soulful vocals, Black crooned through the first verse and chorus. After the performance, the camera then revealed surprise guest Seal himself watching Black’s performance, clearly entertained.</p><a title=@tehawesomedragonreturns href=# rel=noopener>@tehawesomedragonreturns</a> <a title=jackblack href=# rel=noopener>#jackblack</a> <a title=americanidol href=# rel=noopener>#americanidol</a> <a title=kissfromarose href=# rel=noopener>#kissfromarose</a> <a title=seal href=# rel=noopener>#seal</a> <a title=live href=# rel=noopener>#live</a> <a title=music href=# rel=noopener>#music</a> <a title=sing href=# rel=noopener>#sing</a> <a title=funny href=# rel=noopener>#funny</a> <a title=musictok href=# rel=noopener>#musictok</a> <a title=nostalgia href=# rel=noopener>#nostalgia</a> <a title=simoncowell href=# rel=noopener>#simoncowell</a> <a title=paulaabdul href=# rel=noopener>#paulaabdul</a> <a title=randyjackson href=# rel=noopener>#randyjackson</a> <a title=fyp href=# rel=noopener>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=# rel=noopener>#foryou</a> <a title=fypシ href=# rel=noopener>#fypシ</a> <a title=foryoupage href=# rel=noopener>#foryoupage</a> <a title=watch href=# rel=noopener>#watch</a> <a title=trending href=# rel=noopener>#trending</a> <a title=batmanforever href=# rel=noopener>#batmanforever</a> <a title="♬ Kiss from a Rose - Seal" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Kiss from a Rose – Seal</a><p>Despite being short, Black’s take on “Kiss From A Rose” was passionate and surprisingly competent. However, the judges seemed unimpressed. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Abdul</a> offered a tepid “nice job,” while Cowell snarked that Black’s singing was “better than Sanjaya” – referencing that season’s notoriously weak contestant.</p><p>Never one to take himself too seriously, Black simply reveled in the silliness of his cameo. Seal gave the performance his seal of approval, appearing on camera to tell Black it was the “greatest” rendition of his song he’d ever heard, much to Black’s clear enjoyment.</p><p>Though brief, Black’s unexpected cover of “Kiss From A Rose” became an instantly iconic American Idol moment thanks to Black’s captivating, passionate stage presence and surprisingly stellar vocals that impressed far beyond anyone’s expectations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jack-black-s-tenacious-d-bandmate-kyle-gass-was-also-in-the-audience>Jack Black’s Tenacious D Bandmate, Kyle Gass Was Also in The Audience</h2><p>During Black’s iconic 2007 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> performance of “Kiss From A Rose,” eagle-eyed viewers may have noticed a familiar face cheering him on in the audience. As the camera panned across the crowd midway through Black’s soulful serenade, none other than Kyle Gass was shown holding up a single white rose in support of his longtime bandmate.</p><p>Gass, the other half of the comedy rock duo Tenacious D alongside Black, was likely a confusing sight for many American Idol viewers at the time. As video clips of the performance circulated online in recent years, comments like “Everyone commenting not knowing “who the dude with the rose” is” have become popular. Even in 2023, some fans seem unaware that the man with the flower is Black’s partner-in-comedy.</p><p>However, for longtime Tenacious D fans, Gass’s cameo was a fun moment. Though the two have reached great heights as a duo, Black usually receives more mainstream attention as a Hollywood star. Seeing Gass cheer on his bandmate from the American Idol audience provided a nice glimpse at the duo’s enduring friendship.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_TheVoice_Season23_Cast_Art-Streiber_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ USA Best Coach Performances, Ranked" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y6impKGenHqjrcKkZKimXZ%2BupLeMm6Oam5uoeqqvzqegnGWgmr%2Bnu9GmmKeblWK8p3nKoqqsZZanvK55wGapqKuVYryvecCmnKuhk5a7brXDqKNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./german-a1-beginner.html><span>←</span><span>Learn German A1 | German Lessons for Beginners</span></a>
