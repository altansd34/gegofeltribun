A lot had changed since her last time on the show. She became a mother and a fiance. When Simon Cowell asked her why she thought it was her time to return to the competition, she simply said “Cheryl.” The 25-year-old sang “With You” which received rave reviews from the judges. The performance left Cheryl in tears and Amy’s fate on the show seemed promising.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>SINGER RETURNS FOR A SECOND CHANCE TO IMPRESS SIMON COWELL — MAJOR FIGHT WAS NOT IN HER PLAN!

She made it to the next round of the competition where she sang Whitney Houston’s “Greatest Love Of All.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“You know I have a special soft spot for you,” Cheryl said. “Maybe it wasn’t your time previously but I think you sang beautifully up there tonight.” But the other judges were not too impressed with Amy’s performance. Louis Walsh said that it sounded like karaoke. Simon went ahead and said that Cheryl made the right decision the first time around when she did not put Amy through to the live shows.</p><p>Cheryl still gave Amy a “yes” to move on to the next round of the competition but she was the only one just to do so. Amy was left in a pool of tears and Cheryl ran up onto the stage to give her a hug as she was eliminated from the competition.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-amy-blasted-the-show-and-claimed-she-was-set-up>Amy Blasted The Show And Claimed She Was Set Up</h3><p>After appearing on The X Factor, Amy felt like she was only brought back on the show for entertainment purposes. “I was set up and was too naïve to see it,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy told The Sun.</a> “I thought they wanted me back to reunite me with Cheryl, but they wanted to crush my dreams and get Cheryl to cry on camera.
