According to the ballroom dancer, these pros deserve to be where they are now.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>DWTS Pros Slept Over in Sabrina Strasser’s Basement Pre-Fame</h2><p>During the May 11, 2023 episode of Page Six’s Virtual Reali-Tea podcast, Strasser talked about her DWTS connection. Years ago, married couple <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniella Karagach and Pasha Pashkov</a> choreographed a number for Strasser and dance partner Stanislav “Stas” Kochergin. Consequently, these DWTS pros slept in her basement while preparing the routine.</p><p>“They slept in my house, they lived with me for two days because they were choreographing a number and they needed a place to stay,” she said. “So they stayed in my basement and now they’re [on Dancing With the Stars]. And they deserve to be, they’re wonderful.”</p><p>Furthermore, Strasser mentioned that it would be a great opportunity to work with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Val Chmerkovskiy</a> and Karina Smirnoff. Interestingly, the two had cameos back in the premiere season of Dancing Queens. Elsewhere in the interview, Strasser also noted that Mark Ballas and Derek Hough are among her favorite Mirrorball champions.</p><p>“We love them, they’re our idols as well. They’re beautiful dancers,” she said.</p><p>Strasser is one of the six ballroom dancers, currently starring in Bravo’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing Queens</a>. Essentially, this reality series follows the cast members as they actively pursue their ballroom dancing careers. Fans of the series watch these women struggle with their demanding obligations as mothers, wives, friends, and businesswomen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-strasser-s-passion-for-dance-came-from>Where Strasser’s Passion For Dance Came From</h2><p>With her obvious fascination towards DWTS pros, it’s not surprising that Strasser wants to be a part of the competition series someday. The Toronto resident has actually manifested that all six Queens will have their turn in DWTS soon. Furthermore, she even admitted that the long-running series stimulated her passion for ballroom dancing.</p><p>“I think they’re doing a great job at showing how the pros can teach non-pros and, and how non-pros can see how difficult it is,” she said.</p><p>Be that as it may, Strasser also pointed out that real-life dance competitions like Dancing Queens are way more difficult than ones viewers watch on television. According to Strasser, her fellow Queens have to perfect five routines “each time to different music.” This mechanics is unlike DWTS’s where celebrities have to master just one dance a week.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_KenJeong_Weiss-EubanksNBCUniversal-220x147.jpeg alt="Ken Jeong Reveals His Iconic Naked Scene in ‘The Hangover’ was His Own Idea" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlnKGenHqywcSepaxlo6mus3nSmpmroZ6WerTA0ZqqrJ2iYr%2BmwsSao6xllJa7qrHLpZhmo5GnrqitwqFkqZmjna5uvMCsn6SnpmLArbHPrWSipl2dsrN5wZqqnqWVo8Fw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./agt-host-terry-crews-needs-no-excuse-to-take-his-shirt-off-and-were-not-mad.html><span>←</span><span>'AGT' Host Terry Crews Needs No Excuse to Take His Shirt Off and We're Not Mad</span></a>
