According to her, she never really wanted to be a reporter. But then, it was during that period that she met her future husband. She had a lot of mentors who taught and instilled in her a great deal of the qualities that have made her one of the most successful journalists in America. According to her, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she said</a>:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b79eb1f1192ab738.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Emily Beth Stern bio: Interesting details about her age, height, family, net worth, and career</span></p></a>I never wanted to be a reporter. I took a job at the New York Post as a clerk because I couldn’t get a job in magazines, which is what I really wanted to do. I was incredibly lucky — I’ve had a lot of mentors. There was Stuart Marques, who hired me. He was the metro editor at the Post. Allen Salkin, who’s a freelance writer now, he was one of the people who taught me newspaper writing.<p class=align-left>Being a bartender for four years has also aided her conversation style with people by asking them relevant questions for the required answers. After three years of working as a clerk with the New York Post, she was entrusted with the job of documenting <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">events at the City Hall</a>, and since then, there has been no going back from reportage. It was where she found her strength and love for reporting. She later worked for the New York Daily News for more than three years at the beginning of the second millennium.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/77c34aae61eb88fe.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Annie Lederman bio: Amazing facts about the talented comedian</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2008, she went back to her pioneer employer, where she was given the task of covering the presidential campaign at the time.

It came as a shock to many when she took to her official tweeter handle and revealed that, as against what several sources reported about POTUS's weight, he has gained less than ten pounds.</p><p class=align-left>According to her, "POTUS has gained less than ten pounds in office despite several allies and associates saying he appears to have put on more, per WH doctor." This came in response to what Doctor Ronny Jackson reported about the President that he was 239 pounds, 75 inches tall, and also had 68 resting heart rate. However, based on his Body Mass Index of 243 pounds, the President is considered to be <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">obese</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5e005bb6afe8af2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Jessica Hahn and who she is now</span></p></a><h2>Who is Maggie Haberman husband?</h2><p class=align-left>Maggie Haberman husband is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dareh Ardashes Gregorian</a>.
