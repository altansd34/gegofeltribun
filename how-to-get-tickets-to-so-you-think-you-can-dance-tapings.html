Morrison apparently sent a DM to a contestant, but <a href=#>he denied reports</a> that the message was flirtatious.</p><p>Morrison only filmed four episodes of the season, which means this Wednesday’s new episode will be his final appearance as a judge on the show. The series is expected to announce a replacement judge, but there is no news about this yet.</p><p>Currently, the judging panel consists of JoJo Siwa and Stephen “tWitch” Boss. Hopefully we’ll find out soon who will take the third seat going forward.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1353278514.jpg alt="Rita Ora, Taika Waititi Are Reportedly Engaged, Planning Intimate Ceremony" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>so you think you can dance</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuZqyfYrSmwIytoJyjlanAbsDOZqqoZamkwm7Ax6KlpGWppMJur8CnZJ2ZnpiybsDAqaCnn6Nk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-tyne-daly-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Tyne Daly Make?
