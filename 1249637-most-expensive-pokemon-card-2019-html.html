Most of Pokemon cards that were printed in the 1990s are now the rarest to find in the market. Since they are old, they cost more than presently printed copies that are easily accessible. Older cards are worth more money; their cost increases year after year. Avid Pokemon players go for the top 10 rare cards because they know their resale value increases with time.Most rare cards are those in their original printed Pokemon series, and they can be sold expensively.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the cards with limited copies in existence include:</p><ul><li>The Pikachu Illustrator card</li><li>University Magikarp</li><li>MasterKey prize card</li><li>Prerelease Raichu card</li><li>Holographic Shadowless first edition card</li><li>First edition Chansey card</li><li>Full Art Ex card</li><li>Shining Charizard</li><li>Japanese Shiny Espeon</li></ul><h3>Is Charizard the most important Pokemon card in the world?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5dc22c27dfe53f03.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most powerful Pokemon of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What is the best Pokemon card in the world?

Unlike other cards, this one is loved for its holographic print.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, the Pikachu Illustrator card is one of the rarest cards that most players would want to have due to its age and value.
