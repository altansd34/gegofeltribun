Since then, she replaced the spotlight with being behind the camera, and now she is&nbsp;an&nbsp;accomplished author and director. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, the 57-year-old actress reemerged to&nbsp;send an&nbsp;important message to&nbsp;all women who are worried about aging.</p><p><h2>She was ’’deemed’’ old when she hit her 40s.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c6/575/f5f355522bb5f4d6ccd6016724.jpg><p>Justine has not given much thought to&nbsp;aging until the internet <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reminded</a> her: “I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;Google something to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;little research and remind myself of&nbsp;something that happened when&nbsp;I was famous,” so&nbsp;when she entered her name ― Justine Bateman ― Google autocompleted it&nbsp;with: ’’looks old.’’ Justine says she was only around 40&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;that time.</p><p><h2>But that discovery only made her feel better about herself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/128/e13/423617583e90d1829feb8b4ec3.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>When asked if&nbsp;she was ever tempted by&nbsp;cosmetic procedures, Justine says that getting plastic surgery would make her ’’lose all of&nbsp;her authority’’ and that she actually feels good about her appearance as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that she enjoys seeing the ’’evidence’’ that proves she’s now a&nbsp;different person compared to&nbsp;who she was in&nbsp;her 20s.<br></p><p><h2>She even decided to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;book about&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9de/a6c/8df6e65ee29540d3b54d6e5c93.jpg><p>Justine doesn’t judge those who decide to&nbsp;undergo a&nbsp;beauty treatment to&nbsp;look younger, but she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> she feels ’’sad’’ for them: ’’I feel sad for them that they are distracted from the things that they are meant to&nbsp;do&nbsp;in&nbsp;life by&nbsp;this consuming idea that they’ve got to&nbsp;fix their face before anything else happens,’’ she explains. In&nbsp;2021 Bateman released a&nbsp;whole <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>book</a> titled <i>Face: One Square Foot of&nbsp;Skin</i> that deals with this important issue.</p><p><h2>Women shouldn’t dwell on&nbsp;their appearance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8dc/231/750a245c1d9106d0fd02084108.jpg><p>’’Have you heard the news? There’s nothing wrong with your face,’’ Justine captioned an&nbsp;Instagram post to&nbsp;promote her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>book</a>. Bateman uses her personal experiences to&nbsp;depict <a href=# title=society data-link=tag>society</a>’s fascination with how women’s faces change as&nbsp;they get older. When asked if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;beauty in&nbsp;aging, Justine says that she really doesn’t care what others think: ’’I think&nbsp;I look rad. My&nbsp;face represents who I&nbsp;am. I&nbsp;like&nbsp;it, and that’s the end of&nbsp;the road,’’ Justine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> confidently.</p><p>If&nbsp;you enjoyed this topic, we&nbsp;recommend you check out similar articles below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLe2v9OipZ5lkpbBprnAp2Sfp6KisrN5xZqkoqSpYsGqsdJmqq2ZomK8sbHNrGSuqF2Wr7DB02aaoaefqLavs4ytpmaZl5p6r63TrqmapJyuenl9kWxob2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./49200-john-humphrys-smoking-bring-on-the-nanny-state.html><span>←</span><span>John Humphrys - Smoking: Bring on the Nanny State?</span></a>
