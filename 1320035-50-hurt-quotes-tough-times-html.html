And if you can’t help them, at least don’t hurt them.</li><li>The purpose of life, as far as I can tell… is to find a mode of being that’s so meaningful that the fact that life is suffering is no longer relevant. - <i>Jordan Peterson (Maps of Meaning)</i></li><li>So other people hurt me? That’s their problem. Their character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is ordained by nature, what I do by my own. -<i> Marcus Aurelius</i></li><li>A fountain gets muddy with but little stirring up, and does not get clear by our meddling with it but by our leaving it alone.

You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. - <i>Haruki Murakami</i></li><li>If you evade suffering you also evade the chance of joy.

If we know how to suffer, we suffer much less, and we’re no longer afraid of being overwhelmed by the suffering inside. - <i>Thich Nhat Hanh</i></li><li>Step out of the history that is holding you back. Step into the new story you are willing to create. - <i>Oprah Winfrey</i></li><li>Some changes look negative on the surface but you will soon realize that space is being created in your life for something new to emerge. - <i>Eckhart Tolle</i></li><li>No matter how far life pushes you down, no matter how much you hurt, you can always bounce back.</li><li>Nothing on earth consumes a man more quickly than the passion of resentment. - <i>Friedrich Nietzsche</i></li><li>If you see somebody that’s hurting, don’t look away. And if you are hurting, even though it might be hard, try to find that bravery within yourself to dive deep and go tell somebody. - <i>Lady Gaga (Grammys 2019)</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/235ba67697918c2e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best quotes about helping others that will tug at your compassion</span></p></a><h2>Pain quotes</h2><p class=align-left>In most cases, pain is a consequence of being hurt.
