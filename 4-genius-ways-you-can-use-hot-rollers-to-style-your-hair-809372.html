And while many women have ditched them nowadays for their curling irons, there are still some hairstyles that are easier to&nbsp;achieve using rollers. Maybe they need more time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the job, but they can be&nbsp;just as&nbsp;effective as&nbsp;irons. And there are quite a&nbsp;few wonderful hairstyles that you can achieve with them.</p><p><h2>How to&nbsp;prepare your hair for hot rollers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10f/442/bd3b33581e833fc9acf92a08ce.jpg><ul><li>The first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>steps</a> you need to&nbsp;take are to&nbsp;shampoo, condition, and dry your hair thoroughly. Before you start using your hair dryer, <strong>you might need to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;heat protectant</strong> on&nbsp;your hair. Then, before you start rolling, you can spray every strand of&nbsp;your hair with a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;hairspray. But make sure that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;flexible hairspray&nbsp;— these are way easier to&nbsp;style than the usual stiff hairsprays.</li></ul><p><h2>How to&nbsp;section your hair</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78c/714/4904ef5e8281a72006fe75aab3.jpg><ul><li>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very important first step that will make it&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot easier for you to&nbsp;create any beautiful hairstyle. So&nbsp;first, you need to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>section</a> <strong>at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;your head that starts from the roots</strong> up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the crown of&nbsp;your scalp. Then, you should section the right and left sides up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the ears. The hair at&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;your head can be&nbsp;left hanging, since it’s way easier that way.</li></ul><p><h2>1. How to&nbsp;make beach waves</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf6/9c0/61fc8c566286533c2023806092.jpg><p>You will first need to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>section</a> your hair right in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;your head and therefore create 2&nbsp;sides of&nbsp;hair. You can start rolling from the roots and secure any strands around the rollers. This method will <strong>give you a&nbsp;much more secure result</strong> than if&nbsp;you were to&nbsp;start rolling from the ends of&nbsp;your hair and up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the roots. The side and back rollers should be&nbsp;parallel to&nbsp;the ground and all of&nbsp;them should be&nbsp;secured with the necessary pins.</p><p>It’s best to&nbsp;put the bigger rollers at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;your head and the smaller ones on&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;your hair. Leave the rollers on&nbsp;for about 15&nbsp;minutes and then remove them with great care.</p><p><h2>2. How to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;blowout</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d47/6b3/16ee0a5bd88d47e113faaa9117.jpg><p>For this one, you will need to&nbsp;start from the top of&nbsp;your head. You will need to&nbsp;grab the biggest rollers and start rolling from the ends of&nbsp;your hair <strong>until about 2&nbsp;cm from your scalp</strong>. You will probably need 3&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rollers</a> to&nbsp;finish this part of&nbsp;your hair, depending on&nbsp;the volume you have. Then you can move to&nbsp;the hair under your crown and start rolling from the ends to&nbsp;the scalp.</p><p>You will probably <strong>need 2&nbsp;rollers for that area</strong>. Moving to&nbsp;the side hair, you will need to&nbsp;section each side into two parts and start rolling them from the roots and downward, away from your face. After securing your hair, you will need to&nbsp;leave the rollers on&nbsp;for 25&nbsp;to&nbsp;30&nbsp;minutes.</p><p><h2>3. How to&nbsp;create tight curls</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d46/f7e/84d5b35e0dabd14a9ab029b03e.jpg><p>This hairstyle is&nbsp;very similar in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>methodology</a> as&nbsp;the beach waves. You can follow the exact same technique, with the only difference being that you need smaller hair sections. Also, you will need to&nbsp;use the smallest rollers that you have, <strong>preferably 0.75 to&nbsp;1-inch big</strong>. Instead of&nbsp;rolling big portions of&nbsp;hair, you will need to&nbsp;take 1-2 inches of&nbsp;hair at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time and once you’re finished you can leave your curlers on&nbsp;for 30-35&nbsp;minutes.</p><p><h2>4. How to&nbsp;create big ringlets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/095/b0e/e5ec6e5fca885f216e32d9bf33.jpg><p>This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hairstyle</a> is&nbsp;the perfect one for hot rollers, and the technique is&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;the blowout. You will also need to&nbsp;use the biggest rollers you have for your entire head and <strong>grab 2-4 inches of&nbsp;hair at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time</strong>. The difference with the blowout technique is&nbsp;that for your back hair, you will only need to&nbsp;use one roller that will go&nbsp;up&nbsp;until your neck. And you should use some holding spray since there will be&nbsp;too much weight on&nbsp;this one roller.</p><p>After you’ve finished rolling, you can secure your hair with a&nbsp;clamp and leave the rollers on&nbsp;for 20-25&nbsp;minutes. After the time has passed, you can remove the rollers carefully and see the beautiful curls reveal themselves.</p><p><h2>BONUS: Useful tips to&nbsp;know about</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fe/220/a1bdd75b718ccacdf18ef06b56.jpg><ul><li><strong>Don’t sleep with them&nbsp;on: </strong>firstly, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hot rollers</a> retain heat for about 15&nbsp;minutes, so&nbsp;leaving them for longer will have absolutely no&nbsp;effect on&nbsp;your hair. Not only that, but tossing and turning could be&nbsp;horribly damaging to&nbsp;your hair.</li><li><strong>It&nbsp;can cause hair loss: </strong>the only way you can get traction alopecia from them would be&nbsp;if&nbsp;you used them every single day. However, if&nbsp;you only use hot rollers a&nbsp;few times a&nbsp;month or&nbsp;even less, you have nothing to&nbsp;worry about.</li><li><strong>The different types of&nbsp;hot rollers: </strong>depending on&nbsp;what you want to&nbsp;achieve, there are different <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>types</a> of&nbsp;hot rollers: steam rollers, ceramic hair setters, wax core rollers, and rollers that use pulse technology.</li><li><strong>Other products that are useful to&nbsp;have: </strong>your rollers need some help in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;stay put, and clips and pins are the best helpers. A&nbsp;good hair comb is&nbsp;needed, similar to&nbsp;the ones hairdressers use. Also, styling products, like setting sprays, smoothing creams, and hair serums might be&nbsp;needed.</li></ul><p>Have you ever used hot rollers, or&nbsp;do&nbsp;you prefer using a&nbsp;curling iron?
