He made a predictably ridiculous entrance before sitting down to chat with the host.</p><p>When Kelly brought up Venn’s win, the performer responded, “It’s not my fault that I won. It is the British public.” He then admitted, “I was kind of hoping that I [wouldn’t] win, because it’d be so embarrassing. But, I was really happy when they said it. I was like, ‘what?’.”</p><p>Venn, who is from Norway, went on to say that Brits have “such a sense of ridiculous humor.” Kelly predicted that King Charles will enjoy his act when Venn takes the stage at the Royal Variety Performance. She suggested that he should have the king wear his signature yellow vest.</p><p>“King Charles in a high-vis vest… my life will be complete,” Venn said.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FUNNY PERFORMER VIGGO VENN NAMED THE WINNER OF ‘BGT’ SERIES 16</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-viewers-think-of-venn-s-win>What Did Viewers Think of Venn’s Win?</h2><p>Although Venn’s act was obviously popular enough to earn the public’s vote and be named the winner, many viewers were disappointed in the results.

REALLY???????”</p><p>Another user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> a poll asking, “Are you glad to see Viggo Venn as the winner of BGT 2023?” Out of more than 8,000 votes, over 60 percent answered no. The user followed it up by linking to ITV’s officially released <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">voting percentages</a>, showing that Venn received 22 percent of the final vote.</p><p>What do you think of Venn’s win?
