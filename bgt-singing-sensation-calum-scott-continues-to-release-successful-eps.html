What happened to </strong><a href=#><strong>Britain’s Got Talent</strong><strong>’s</strong></a><strong> singing sensation after he won sixth place in the competition? Is this </strong><strong>BGT</strong><strong> singer a worldwide superstar, or is he still on the path to ultimate stardom?</strong></p><p>Calum took to the Britain’s Got Talent stage after his sister in 2015. He was seen in tears at the beginning of the performance because his sister wasn’t chosen. As soon as he began to sing, it was obvious that he had nerves going into his audition, but he shocked everyone with how great his voice was. In his audition he sang “Dancing on My Own” by Robyn. Without any notes from the judges, Simon Cowell hit the golden buzzer for this amazing singer.</p><p>That was truly only the beginning for Calum. Later in the competition the judges told him that he already sounded like a recording artist and that great success around the world is waiting for him. Unfortunately, Calum stumbled over his words in the series nine finale of BGT. Even though stumbling over his words he was able to win sixth place in the competition.&nbsp;</p><p>After Britain’s Got Talent, Calum went and performed a series of shows around the United Kingdom. Then he went on to release his cover of “<a href=#>Dancing on My Own</a>” about a year after his BGT season ended. Even though this song was loved on the show, it was slow to hit the charts. It hit number 40 on the charts in May but once it took off, it really took off. This song was certified platinum by August.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-calum-begins-releasing-music-of-his-own>Calum Begins Releasing Music of His Own</h2><p>Calum signed a record deal with Capitol Records who’s known for signing Halsey, Sam Smith, 5 Seconds of Summer, and more. In 2017 he toured the U.S. and released the single “<a href=#>You are the Reason</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the following year Calum released his first album Only Human. He decided that his album would truthfully represent himself and his story. This album was basically Calum coming out as gay to the world.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wasted my teens and 20s in the fear of coming out and as I got older I was ashamed of myself for being gay,” <a href=#>said</a> Calum.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Britain’s Got Talent he had told a few friends about his sexuality but had never come out to his dad. Calum wanted to release this album knowing that he was being true to himself, and that’s exactly what he did.&nbsp;</p><p>Later that year Calum released a single titled “No Matter What” and shared that this was his <a href=# class=broken_link>most personal song</a> to date. He said that this song was born from loneliness, acceptance and the heartbreaking but liberating tale of his coming out experience. What’s great about this song is that it speaks on acceptance as a whole and is not limited to only a story of sexual identity. It talks about a relationship between a parent and a child and doesn’t have to only be about sexuality. At the time of Only Human’s release Calum was not yet ready to share this story.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Calum Up to in 2022?</h2><p>Calum has been truly riding the Britain’s Got Talent wave. In 2019, Only Human was certified silver in the United Kingdom. This was when he became extremely busy. In 2020 Calum partnered with an American Watch company to develop a music documentary series called “Minutes with Calum.” This series gave fans a behind the scenes look at the creative process behind his second studio album. To this day, Calum has yet to release this album.</p><p>Instead, he’s released a slew of EPs and singles in 2021. As of right now he’s released three EPs and ten singles. His most recent single, “If You Ever Change Your Mind,” was just released on February 4.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems like Calum’s career is definitely on an upswing in early 2022. He currently has 837,000 followers on Instagram, 1.6 million followers on Facebook, 5.81 million subscribers on YouTube and over 787,800 followers on Tiktok. I can’t wait to see what this singer does next.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZuTJt-IIZB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-18-at-3.44.15-PM-Large.jpeg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Season 7 Previews Cuddly Baby Mammoth Costume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>BGT</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>calum scott</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waCrZquZo7SqusZmqp6mo5bBqrvNZpqapKWierSvzq2rZpufo8GqutSeqmasn2K%2FprjEmqqeZaOqsKSx0qydrqRdmr20ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./30668-women-pay-more-twice-much-haircuts.html><span>←</span><span>Women pay more than twice as much for haircuts</span></a>
