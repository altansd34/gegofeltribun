There truly is something for everyone and although drag is not for everyone, it is for a lot of people. Here is a list of drag queens from America’s Got Talent that we love and you will too.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Gingzilla</h2><p>Gingzilla appeared on America’s Got Talent season 14 as a 7 foot tall lady with a ginger beard and deep voice. Not only was Gingzilla a good singer, she made the audience die of laughter. This drag queen is both known and loved throughout the competition show community. She’s also appeared on the <a href=#>X Factor UK</a> and <a href=#>Queen of the Universe</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-scarlett-business>2. Scarlett Business</h2><p>This drag queen took the stage during season 16 as a drag contortionist. She showed up in a full body red suit to perform a hand balance and contortion act. On top of performing her talent she lip sang along to “Woman” by Ke$ha. Her performance was so cool because it brought together two different types of talents.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-alyssa-edwards-s-dance-crew-beyond-belief-dance-company>3. Alyssa Edwards’s Dance Crew, Beyond Belief Dance Company</h2><p>While this wasn’t a drag performance, a big part of this audition was RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant Alyssa Edwards taking the stage. Since her love of dance began when she was a kid, she teaches children of her own. This drag queen was an absolute icon on RuPaul’s Drag Race, so it’s only right that she’s treated the same on AGT.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-the-spice-gurlz>4. <strong>The Spice Gurlz</strong></h2><p>The Spice Gurlz first appeared on Season 11 of America’s Got Talent. This group consists of Jay, Stavros, Justin, J.C., and Mark, a set of Spice Girls impersonators. As kids they were inspired by NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Boys II Men, and the Spice Girls. Their act consisted of dancing together and lip-syncing to Spice Girls’ “Spice Up Your Life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLvFqXHPmqU</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-stephanie-s-child>5. <strong>Stephanie’s Child</strong></h2><p>This set of three drag queens took the America’s Got Talent stage in season 14. Stephanie’s Child is comprised of Jan Sport, Rosé, and Lagoona Bloo. In their audition they sang “Bang Bang” by Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj, and Jessie J. While the other judges loved them, Simon Cowell voted no.</p><p>This group came back to the AGT stage with fiery for the judges cut round. In this round they sang “Sorry Not Sorry” and “Confident” by Demi Lovato. Even though they truly put on a show, Cowell hit his red buzzer for them. Following AGT, Jan Sport and Rosé both appeared on RuPaul’s Drag Race in 2019 and 2020. Before this series, they performed on The Voice Season 13 finale in 2017 as backup singers for contestant Chris Weaver.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-emmanuel-phillip-hudson>6. Emmanuel & Phillip Hudson</h2><p>These contestants took the America’s Got Talent stage to audition for season nine. These men were dressed as females to sing their original piece “Ratchet Girl Anthem.” While Howard Stern and Heidi Klum didn’t like the group, Howie Mandel completely disagreed. He explained that they are a brilliant comedy act. To save them from a failed audition, Mandel hit his Golden Buzzer for them after two out of four judges gave them a “no.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtazabgFF54</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jake-hoot-the-voice-winner-.jpg alt="Everything You Need to Know About ‘The Voice’ Winner Jake Hoot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>drag queens</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57lGabq5mXYr62scSnqmasmJbBbr%2FHqKakZZGisrO1wpqqZp%2BfqXq1rcuepa1lmqqxqLXNoGSpmZ6auXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-love-story-of-peter-dinklage-and-erica-schmidt-proves-that-true-love-doesnt-need-anyones-validation-808697.html><span>←</span><span>The Love Story of Peter Dinklage and Erica Schmidt Proves That True Love Doesnt Need Anyones V</span></a>
