They sang “Dynamite” by BTS, the smash hit that has been taking over the radio since its release last year.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwpRIrodoes</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-top-20-contestants-slay-dynamite-by-bts>‘The Voice’ Top 20 Contestants Slay ‘Dynamite’ by BTS</h2><p>The music video is colorful, energetic, and really highlights each of the contestant’s unique voices. In the beginning, some contestants are shown picking out their outfits. Marshalls styled all of them and have provided them with their fun wardrobe selections.</p><p>They pulled out all of the stops for this music video. Several contestants sat on golf carts for their solo moments. Country boy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenzie Wheeler</a> singing BTS is everything we never knew we needed. Dancers put on quite the show in the background as some of the other contestants sang in the NBC lot. Cam Anthony absolutely owned this part of the video.</p><p>You may even recognize the iconic staircase that some of the contestants stood on from the photoshoot and music video that The Voice coaches did last season ahead of the premiere.</p><p>Ryleigh Modig led the contestants down the street as they all danced around and sang the Billboard US Hot 100 hit that is stuck in all of our heads. In a very rare occurrence, all of the contestants did some choreography. One thing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ARMY</a> loves about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BTS</a> is that they are never afraid to pick up intricate choreography.</p><p>The Voice contestants took a crack at nailing some seriously awesome dance moves. Dana Monique is quite the dancer and totally stole the show in her hot pink jumpsuit. Victor Solomon rocked his salmon-colored blazer and showed everyone up in this performance.</p><p>BTS performed at the finale of The Voice back in 2019 and sang “Boy with Luv.” The video of this performance now has over 30 million views on YouTube which is telling to how much the ARMY is dedicated to showing love to the South Korean boyband.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dana-Monique-The-Voice-Kelly-Clarkson-Nick-Jonas-The-Voice-Top-17.jpg alt="Kelly Clarkson Throws Stuff at ‘The Voice’ Contestant After Epic Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedOop2ZqYGK9pr7FqKmmZZSuu6K5yK2cZpqpYq%2B1v44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drag-race-stars-ginger-minj-kornbread-kahmora-hall-to-star-in-hocus-pocus-2.html><span>←</span><span>'Drag Race' Stars Ginger Minj, Kornbread, Kahmora Hall to Star in 'Hocus Pocus 2'</span></a>
