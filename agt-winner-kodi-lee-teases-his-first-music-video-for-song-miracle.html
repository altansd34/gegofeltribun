As he sings on the track, “Every day’s a miracle / Every hour wonderful.”</p><p>Now Lee is preparing to share his very first music video to go along with the song. He posted a clip on Instagram Monday, in which he can be seen wearing a sparkly silver jacket while playing the piano. The shot cuts to a clip of him singing when he was younger.</p><p>“SURPRISE!” the caption of the preview reads. “Guess What Guys! I’m releasing my first music video ever! HECK YEAH!! Are you subscribed to my Youtube!? Go subscribe and get ready for the ‘Miracle’ music video!”</p><p>Lee didn’t share a release date for the music video, but fans can subscribe to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a> to stay updated.
