Co-hosts Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough are looking extremely dazzling in the series’ brand-new promotional post.</p><p>“This dazzling duo is ready to co-host the new season of #DWTS. Coming this fall, catch @therealalfonsoribeiro and @juleshough on your screens, live on @ABCNetwork and @DisneyPlus! Stream next day on Hulu,” the caption read.</p><p>In the post, Hough is wearing a V-cut silver bodycon gown. The gorgeous ensemble is made even more stunning with a bold red lip. Meanwhile, Ribeiro looks completely dashing in a royal blue suit.</p><p>For those who may not know, in March, Variety announced that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hough</a> will be returning to DWTS, this time as a co-host. For season 32, the back-to-back champion will assume Ribeiro’s previous role on the program.</p><p>“It is such an honor to be rejoining Dancing with the Stars as co-host. The show holds such a special place in my heart from the many years and different roles I have had the privilege of being a part of,” she said.</p><p>Fortunately, fans approve of Hough as replacement of former host Tyra Banks.

I’m dying to know,” one fan commented.</p><p>At present, fans are only getting clues by removing DWTS pros who have already announced their non-participation.
