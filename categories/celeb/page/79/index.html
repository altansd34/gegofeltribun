Some movie performances leave&nbsp;us in&nbsp;awe at&nbsp;how well actors embody their characters and live in&nbsp;the moment. In&nbsp;some cases, however, the fear we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;screen is&nbsp;very real and we&nbsp;might not even know&nbsp;it. What’s even more challenging is&nbsp;when actors need to&nbsp;overcome their own phobias to&nbsp;film a&nbsp;scene, and we&nbsp;applaud every single one of&nbsp;them.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side dove deep into actors’ struggles on&nbsp;set and gained a&nbsp;new level of&nbsp;admiration for their work.

Back in&nbsp;the previous century, Coco Chanel and Greta Garbo decided to&nbsp;be&nbsp;single for different reasons. And today, many famous women follow the examples of&nbsp;these successful ladies. Kylie Minogue, Charlize Theron, and Emilia Clarke have never been married and can hardly imagine themselves as&nbsp;wives.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side found out who among very popular and beautiful women decided not to&nbsp;tie the knot and have no&nbsp;regrets.
Charlize Theron, 46&nbsp;years old

“Why spend money on&nbsp;new things when we&nbsp;can use the old ones?” was probably the mindset of&nbsp;movie makers when they decided to&nbsp;use costumes that had already been used in&nbsp;previous movies. Most films and&nbsp;TV series just don’t have enough money to&nbsp;dress the entire cast in&nbsp;entirely new costumes. And if&nbsp;a&nbsp;dress was especially good (like it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;Titanic) why not take the chance and use it&nbsp;again?
Bright Side has chosen several examples of&nbsp;when characters from different movies wore the exact same clothes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>15 Wild Animals That People Found a Place for in Their Homes and Their Hearts</h2><time>Aug 16, 2024</time>

From a&nbsp;rescued cow enjoying regular bubble baths, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wild fox cozily cuddling with a&nbsp;dog in&nbsp;their owner’s bed, to&nbsp;an&nbsp;injured kangaroo living happily together with its owners&nbsp;— these are just a&nbsp;few examples of&nbsp;how people happened to&nbsp;share their homes and hugs with animals who were born to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;the wild.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side need to&nbsp;remind you that keeping a&nbsp;wild animal in&nbsp;your apartment can be&nbsp;dangerous.
