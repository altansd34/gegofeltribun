<a href=../../../../mars-is-planning-to-destroy-its-own-moon-816292.html></a>
However, Phobos is&nbsp;gradually moving closer to&nbsp;Mars due to&nbsp;gravity, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;predicted that it&nbsp;will eventually be&nbsp;destroyed by&nbsp;the planet’s gravity within the next thirty-fifty million years. I&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;around then. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;imagine this will result in&nbsp;a&nbsp;ring of&nbsp;debris around Mars, similar to&nbsp;Saturn’s rings. However, this process is&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural phenomenon and not an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;destruction by&nbsp;Mars.
Apparently, Phobos is&nbsp;getting ripped apart by&nbsp;the crazy gravitational forces of&nbsp;the Red Planet! But wait, there’s more! Phobos has these crazy parallel grooves all over its surface.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>N700bn: ICPC Share Fresh Details of Paid Bribes in Nigeria in 2023</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../13694-one-five-workers-have-pulled-sickie-year.html></a>
19% of British workers have lied to avoid going into work in the past 12 months – and ‘flaking’ among young Brits is extremely highWe need more time in bed in the winter and are more likely to get ill. We also drink more in the run up to Christmas, exacerbating both of those things. This makes it harder to get out of bed, and more tempting to call in sick, exaggerate our sickness or make up some other lie to get out of going to work in the morning.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Piano most popular | YouGov</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

Despite the crisis of coronavirus every where in the world, Manchester United have completed the signing of 16-year-old goalkeeper Radek Vitek who joined from Czech giants Sigma Olomouc.
For the Red Devils to have sealed his deal during the covid-19 bug which has found its way into arguably every part of the world, then the goalkeeper must have good potentials.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/celeb/page/28/>← Prev Page</a>
