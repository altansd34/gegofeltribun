Sometimes we&nbsp;forget that even the most prominent examples of&nbsp;masculinity can hide a&nbsp;very tender and sensitive heart inside.

Baywatch first aired just over 30&nbsp;years ago, and since then it&nbsp;has been one of&nbsp;the most popular&nbsp;TV shows.

However, the question now is&nbsp;what they are like today, after all these years.
Bright Side brings you a&nbsp;throwback to&nbsp;the cast of&nbsp;Baywatch next to&nbsp;their famous characters, with the added bonus of&nbsp;Yasmine Bleeth’s transformation at&nbsp;the end.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Which Acts Made It to the Season 18 Finals?</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>
