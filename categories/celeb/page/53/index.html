Genetics is&nbsp;extremely peculiar. Sometimes, we&nbsp;find children who are photocopies of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their parents and others who have a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;both parents’ traits. On&nbsp;occasions, siblings look a&nbsp;lot like each other. But sometimes, they don’t share many characteristics or&nbsp;they don’t even look like siblings. This is&nbsp;the case with the Willis sisters: One of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;the spitting image of&nbsp;her mother, Demi Moore, the other is&nbsp;a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;her father, Bruce Willis, and the third is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;both of&nbsp;them.
Bright Side brings you a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;comparisons of&nbsp;celebrity parents and their children, where genetics did their thing, making them look nothing alike.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>18 Funny and Slightly Embarrassing Things We All Did as Kids</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>

Don’t you think that childhood is&nbsp;a&nbsp;magical time? When nostalgia strikes, it’s a&nbsp;pleasure to&nbsp;remember certain fun little habits&nbsp;we (almost) all had when we&nbsp;were kids. These included talking in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the fan to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;sound as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were “a&nbsp;robot” or&nbsp;cutting your dolls’ hair. These are habits are pretty common when we&nbsp;are kids. But now, many years later, when we’ve grown into responsible and serious adults, we&nbsp;can’t help but wonder, what we&nbsp;were thinking when doing those things.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>20 Misleading Photos Where Its Hard to Unsee What You Have Already Seen</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>

With close to 500 million native speakers and many more students in the process of acquiring such competency, Spanish is one of the most widely-spoken languages in the world. However, while it originated in Spain many hundreds of years ago, it may surprise you to learn that the largest Spanish-speaking country is actually Mexico.

<a href=../../../../almost-half-u-s-voters-arent-sure-russia-engaged-election-related-hacks.html></a>
Almost half of Americans do not agree with the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that the Russian government was behind cyberattacks on the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, according to a new Morning Consult/POLITICO survey.
