While Republicans said in December they consider Fox News the most credible media outlet, more than half of them also gave credence to the top broadcast networks and The New York Times, which is often critiqued by Trump.</p><p>Representatives from the media outlets mentioned in this story were not immediately available for comment.</p><p><strong>Correction:</strong> A previous version of this story misrepresented how many people consider ABC and CBS to be credible news sources.</p><p>Morning Consult’s <a href=#>Best Loved Brands Spring 2017</a>&nbsp;uses nearly&nbsp;200,000 interviews with American adults to provide an in-depth view of the companies, organizations and brands that define American culture and commerce. Net favorable scores subtract the percentage of people who give a company an unfavorable rating from the percentage that gave a favorable rating. This gives a snapshot of how well liked a company is, without penalizing companies for being not as well known.
