More than half of the app’s daily users (57%) said they have a favorable opinion of the NBA, compared with 43% of all adults — the largest gap among the leagues. MLS came in second with a 10-point gap.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The NBA’s success with TikTok is not surprising, as the prescient basketball league was quick to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>sign a partnership in 2018</a> to deliver custom highlights to fans around the world via the burgeoning app. Today, the NBA has 20.5 million followers on TikTok, compared with 12.1 million for the NFL and 6.9 million for MLB.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The data makes it clear that sports leagues should experiment and try new approaches for producing content on TikTok in pursuit of virality, while pointing these engaged consumers toward their online shops, given daily TikTok users’ heightened levels of purchase consideration toward the leagues. For example, the NBA’s 10-second clip of Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler’s latest hairstyle has nearly 7.5 million views and over 10,000 comments on TikTok. A link to the Heat’s online shop with the post, pointing fans toward Butler’s jersey, would have likely benefited the team’s bottom line.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Another route is the platform’s recent foray into live e-commerce. <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Launched last month</a>, TikTok Shop allows users to find and buy products seen in videos on the app, and could emerge as a handy tool for leagues, athletes and brands to point fans toward new products.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>How other leagues can make strides on TikTok</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While the NBA leads the pack among regular TikTok users, other leagues are actively working to catch up.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">MLB, the only major league whose favorability underindexed among daily TikTok users when compared with the general population, has turned popular TikTok creators into league ambassadors via a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>partnership</a> signed in 2021. MLS, meanwhile, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>signed a multiyear deal</a> with TikTok in March that includes the formation of the Club Creator Network, a program that will connect creators and influencers with MLS clubs to produce exclusive content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>more than 3 in 5 Gen Z adults</a> report using TikTok each day, MLB has an opportunity to reach young potential fans about recent rule changes it has made to address criticism that America’s pastime is too slow or lacks action. Hence, it’s easy to picture a lighthearted TikTok clip that further explains the reasoning behind the new pitch clock and why it’s designed to improve the viewing experience. A well-executed video could go a long way in turning some disinterested or casual observers into dedicated fans.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6m2rMDOpGSipaCWsLV50qmmq6yjYrqivsqeq6Kml2K8r7jIp5xmq5ikvbQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1469007-who-kylie-prew-all-jojo-siwas-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kylie Prew: all about JoJo Siwas ex-girlfriend and their relationship</span></a>
