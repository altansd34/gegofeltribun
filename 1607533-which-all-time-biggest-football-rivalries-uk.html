The Merseyside derby</h2><p class=align-left>Liverpool v Everton is still one of the biggest football rivalries in the UK. The game used to be one of the few in which all of the fans sat together. However, because the teams are separated only by Stanley Park, the teams are quite close, with the rivalry dividing many families and houses in the city, earning the nickname "The Friendly Derby."</p><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources,</a> Everton played their home games at Anfield before a number of board members left to form another club, Liverpool FC. The teams first met in 1894 and have played 233 times since then. The clubs have been meeting season after season since 1962, making it the UK's longest-running top-flight derby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b400b08a5f009afb.jpeg><p class=align-left>Both were vying for league titles and cups during their heydays in the 1980s, which sparked a lot of rivalries because matches against each other were so important to their success. The animosity has also pushed the derby to the top of the list for most red cards.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ffae670d28b7bfc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Funniest moments of Paris 2024 Olympics including Turkish shooter with insane aura</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The clubs have had their fair share of success, but when it comes down to it, Liverpool has always been a step ahead of its rivals. Liverpool is continuing to pull away from their Merseyside rivals, holding the bragging rights affair more than before, following the recent victories in both England and <a href=#>Europe</a>.</p><h2>5. Arsenal v Manchester United</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/2061b8097d9c93f8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Two of the English heavyweights in football from different parts turned to become one of the biggest soccer rivalries in England. Both clubs have been in the same division since 1919 when they first met in 1894.</p><p class=align-left>The rivalry reached its pinnacle in the 1990s and 2000s when Arsenal was led by Arsène Wenger, called "the professor," and United was led by Alex Ferguson. The 'battlefield' was unique, only comparable to the then-El Classico (Real Madrid vs. Barcelona), other biggest rivalries in European football.</p><p class=align-left>After Arsenal's Invincibles season, the Red Devils interrupted their unbeaten record, adding spice to an already acrimonious rivalry. The teams underwent a transition in 2005, as Chelsea began to dominate the division before Manchester City arrived in 2012.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5c9e0382a7a0a709.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Supercomputer predicts which team will win the EPL title</span></p></a><h2>4. The Manchester Derby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ffae670d28b7bfc.jpeg><p class=align-left>The battle for supremacy in Manchester has always been between the two, resulting in the lingo "which colour is Manchester?" Being one of the biggest rivalries in soccer, the match has recently risen to become one of football's most prestigious derbies. In 1881, the two clubs first met.</p><p class=align-left>The Red Devils were known as Newtown Heath, while the Blues were known as St. Mark's (West Gorton), and their fields were 4 miles apart, another example of family members splitting in support of their favourite.</p><p class=align-left>The rivalry was not as acrimonious until Sergio Kun Aguero grabbed the Premier League title from Manchester United on goal difference in 2011/12, putting an end to Alex Ferguson's moniker of "noisy neighbors." His last-minute goal ended the Cityzens' 44-year championship drought. This was to be the turning point for Manchester's blue side, and they've only gotten stronger since then.</p><p class=align-left>The rivalry coin has now been tossed on the other side since its United's turn to watch <i>Cityzens</i> clinch the titles. United are now fighting for the top four positions while the city is enjoying at the top, Liverpool being the only threat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/70a10b942b3fc457.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Canada's most popular sports: Which are the most famous sports in Canada?</span></p></a><h2>3. The North London derby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/cb2f2c6e7a3c1f82.jpeg><p class=align-left>This has always been one of the fiercest football rivalries in the UK, with both teams being from North <a href=#>London</a>. Their first match took place in 1887. The rivalry began in 1913, when Arsenal relocated to Highbury in North London, only four miles away, a decision that Tottenham strongly opposed.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, the rivalry was sparked by a contentious promotion more than a century ago, in 1919, when the league was to be extended by two clubs through voting. According to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources</a> the favourites of the promotion were Chelsea and Tottenham. Chelsea's nomination would be a foregone conclusion because their relegation had been contentious in the first place.</p><p class=align-left>Arsenal received 18 votes, while Tottenham received eight, despite Arsenal finishing sixth in the Second Division the previous season. All of the Tottenham authorities were enraged by the behavior, and the rivalry was born.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e8010601940991f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Oldest football stadiums: Which was the first football stadium ever built?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Between the two clubs, over 200 games have been played, with the Gunners coming out on top. It was only in 2017 when Spurs finally broke a 22-year spell of finishing below Arsenal in the premier league. In 1976–77, Tottenham was demoted for the first time since the 1950s, and its the only season they did not meet.</p><h2>2. Manchester United v Liverpool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5c9e0382a7a0a709.jpeg><p class=align-left>The clubs were some of the biggest soccer rivalries in England, with the rivalry traced back to the 19th century, later spanning across decades. Economic and industrial disparities sparked the rivalry between the two cities. The principal port in England at the time was Liverpool, and the city of Manchester was paid exorbitant fees for sea access.</p><p class=align-left>Manchester built its canal through Liverpool later, giving them a sense of supremacy, which is why a boat appears on the Manchester United and Manchester City emblems. Although their football rivalry did not begin until the 1960s, the canal construction reignited the rivalry between the two communities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/85f436ea9c437212.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all La Liga teams that have never been relegated</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With the arrival of Bill Shankly in the 1960s, Liverpool controlled the league for over two decades. It was about this time when Matt Busby left Manchester United, leading the club to suffer until Sir Alex Ferguson was appointed in 1986.</p><p class=align-left>The appointment ushered in a sea change that no one could have predicted, with Liverpool's success waning and the United dominating for the next three decades. The desire to become the most successful club in the United Kingdom sparked the most intense rivalry in soccer history. Even today, Liverpool are United's biggest rivals.</p><h2>1. The Old Firm Derby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/d079e43e51b0de9a.jpeg><p class=align-left>The derby is termed as the biggest rivalry in British football. The Old Firm is the collective name for the two Scottish clubs, Celtic and Rangers, both located in Glasgow. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources,</a> their rivalry has become deeply embedded past the limits of football and into deeper national, religious and political identities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/57197277aa59bfe4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>English Premier League teams that have never been relegated</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Most of the biggest football rivalries in the UK are also part of the biggest soccer rivalries in the <a href=#>world</a> due to the club's success and the intense competition in the leagues.
