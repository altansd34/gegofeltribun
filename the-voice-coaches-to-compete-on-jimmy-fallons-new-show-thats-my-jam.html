Fans of the show love to see how the celebrity coaches get along during each round of the competition. Next month, instead of seeing the coaches in their normal red chairs, fans will see them in pairs battling on behalf of their chosen charities.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>, Ariana Grande, Kelly Clarkson, and <a href=#>John Legend</a> will be the first to compete on Jimmy Fallon’s new series That’s My Jam. This series extends Fallon’s beloved mini-games from The Tonight Show in a competition format. Within this series fans will see some of Fallon’s most beloved mini-games like “Wheel of Impossible Karaoke,” “Perfect Mashup,” “Vinyl Countdown,” and “<a href=#>Slay It, Don’t Spray It</a>.”</p><p>Each episode of the series will feature four celebrities in groups of two. The pairs will compete in music, dance, and trivia games to earn money for their chosen charity.</p><p>The Voice coaches will be the first celebrities to play in the mini-game series. Their sneak peek episode will air on November 29 at 10 p.m. ET. Following their episode, That’s My Jam will begin airing regularly in early 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu_qIs_gBqd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-the-voice-coaches>Why The Voice Coaches?</h2><p>It’s no secret that people love to see their favorite celebrities play Fallon’s games. The mini-games from The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon are some of the most watched videos on the internet. For example, Grande’s “Wheel of Impressions” game from 2015 currently has 159 million views on <a href=#>YouTube</a>. I think the expansion of these mini-games will be an automatic hit for the network.</p><p>The decision of the first set of celebrities was definitely easy for producers given that Grande’s videos are so popular. Plus The Voice is the most watched series on NBC in the past decade and she happens to be apart of it right now. NBC is trying to keep fans of The Voice tuned in for another hour so they can see the judges on the new show.</p><p>The network definitely knows that fans love to see the coaches battle it out during blind auditions, so they knew these celebrity pairs would get a lot of attention. We know our coaches are extremely competitive on The Voice, so it’ll be interesting to see how competitive they get during the new show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-10.09.jpg alt="‘BGT’ Star Calum Scott Delivers Inspiring Performance of New Song ‘Rise’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>jimmy fallon</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecKomJyglah6tbuMnKamqJWpsm67zWahoqWdrnqnrculpqerXaOyuHnSoaawZaSdrrW%2FjKawZqKRonw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./you-dont-have-to-shave-for-the-beach-2-women-claim-and-receive-mixed-reactions-813875.html><span>←</span><span>You Dont Have to Be Hairless to Wear a Bikini, 2 Women Claim and a Debate Ensues</span></a>
