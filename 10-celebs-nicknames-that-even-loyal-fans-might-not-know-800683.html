Keanu Reeves<i>, </i>a.k.a. “The Wall”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d6/a60/b3946850d3932f8b291a8cd9be.jpg><p>The acclaimed actor was so&nbsp;good as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>hockey goalie</strong>, it&nbsp;earned him his <a href=#>nickname</a>. Luckily for all of&nbsp;us, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;follow his second passion later in&nbsp;life, which was acting.</p><p><h2>2. Mila Kunis, a.k.a. “Goldfish”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d6/873/98db1d52ef99c3dcd78b929c44.jpg><p><a href=#>Goldfish</a> are often thought to&nbsp;have very <strong>short memories</strong>. And according to&nbsp;Mila’s best friends, she also tends to&nbsp;forget stuff, which earned her this funny <a href=#>nickname</a>.</p><p><h2>3. Queen Elizabeth<i>, </i>a.k.a. “Gary”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/442/c07/e70e6852f3ba615afbd8dbecb9.jpg><p>The story says that at&nbsp;one time, a&nbsp;young <strong><a href=# title="Prince William" data-link=tag>Prince William</a></strong> fell inside Kensington Palace and yelled, “Gary!” A&nbsp;staff member approached him and asked him who Gary was. Right at&nbsp;that moment, <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a> arrived and replied that she was “Gary.” It&nbsp;was probably William’s difficulty with pronouncing “granny” that brought about the funny nickname.</p><p><h2>4. Jennifer Lawrence, a.k.a. “Nitro”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2f9/a7e/a1850c56e482ef5e8a873b864b.jpg><p>The actress used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;<strong>hyperactive</strong> when she was a&nbsp;kid that her brothers gave her this suitable <a href=#>nickname</a>. They still use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;this day just to&nbsp;annoy her.</p><p><h2>5. Hugh Jackman, a.k.a. “Sticks”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/062/9c1/2c2a0f5813aa95b58890b16d54.jpg><p>We&nbsp;might know <a href=# title="Hugh Jackman" data-link=tag>Hugh Jackman</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;muscular, fitness enthusiast, but he&nbsp;wasn’t always like that. <a href=#>Growing&nbsp;up</a>, he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;have very <strong>skinny legs</strong>, something that rightfully earned him his nickname.</p><p><h2>6. Tom Hardy, a.k.a. “Weasel”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f76/7de/3a58e356fe8e232e4a04237577.jpg><p>The actor was a&nbsp;wild kid who used to&nbsp;dislike school and would hang out in&nbsp;the streets with his friends instead. He&nbsp;acted out a&nbsp;lot as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid and got close to&nbsp;getting <strong>expelled</strong> from his secondary school. And because of&nbsp;this phase in&nbsp;his life, he&nbsp;acquired this <a href=#>nickname</a>.</p><p><h2>7. Bella Thorne, a.k.a. “Pickle”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/119/996/1da190510e859a72a46da909dc.jpg><p><strong><a href=# title="Drew Barrymore" data-link=tag>Drew Barrymore</a></strong> has been a&nbsp;longtime friend of&nbsp;Bella’s and is&nbsp;fully responsible for her <a href=#>nickname</a>. While we&nbsp;don’t know its origin story, we&nbsp;can assume it’s because of&nbsp;Bella’s love for <a href=#>pickle juice</a>.</p><p><h2>8. Lewis Hamilton, a.k.a. “Hawkeye”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08c/cdb/be22365da6b8e496a9a4aaa837.jpg><p><a href=#>According</a> to&nbsp;the F1&nbsp;driver’s friends, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>perfectionist</strong> who sees small details that others can’t see. He&nbsp;will notice a&nbsp;small gap that will put him ahead of&nbsp;his opponents or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;thread that’s out of&nbsp;place during a&nbsp;photo shoot.</p><p><h2>9. Liam Payne, a.k.a. “Cheesy Head”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7b/6aa/aa49ed59e3842f92cf127d7d9a.jpg><p>His love for <strong>cheesy chips</strong> is&nbsp;the one and only reason for the funny <a href=#>nickname</a> that followed him throughout his childhood. And, of&nbsp;course, his sister is&nbsp;the one who came up&nbsp;with&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>10. Lea Michele, a.k.a. “Grandma”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e75/1d3/b70ce8584687761dc4846044fb.jpg><p>The actress has confided that <strong>her friends</strong> have given her the unusual nickname. The <a href=#>reason</a> for it&nbsp;is&nbsp;because she doesn’t like what people her age typically like, such as&nbsp;going to&nbsp;clubs or&nbsp;listening to&nbsp;loud music. Instead, she prefers sitting at&nbsp;home and watching a&nbsp;good&nbsp;TV show.</p><p><h2>11. Priyanka Chopra, a.k.a. “Mimi”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c5/0a5/835987524887ee4c01108dfe99.jpg><p>“Mitthoo” was the actress’s first <a href=#>nickname</a> because she was very <strong>chatty</strong> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid, repeating everything and everyone. However, her mom used to&nbsp;call her “<a href=# title=Mimi data-link=tag>Mimi</a>” due to&nbsp;her resemblance to&nbsp;the French actress, Mimi Rodgers. And Priyanka showed a&nbsp;preference for “Mimi” simply because of&nbsp;it&nbsp;being more positive than “Mitthoo.”</p><p><h2>12. Blake Shelton, a.k.a. “Toad”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd8/8ef/12cee95e31b608a34f7ed15b6e.jpg><p>Young Blake used to&nbsp;love catching <strong>bugs and frogs</strong> and bringing them back home. That’s why his mom started <a href=#>calling</a> him “Toad.” She has also said that Blake loved all animals, and when she killed a&nbsp;fly one time, he&nbsp;started crying.</p><p><h2>13. Daniel Radcliffe, a.k.a. “Shrimpy”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/19e/ea5/79b23d50acb7f67475fdfd7722.jpg><p>The <a href=#>actor</a> used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very <strong>pale and skinny</strong> when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kid. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;made sense for those around him to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;a&nbsp;nickname that would poke fun at&nbsp;his figure.</p><p><h2>14. Cameron Diaz, a.k.a. “Skeletor”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d1/954/c46f4a5823a2fbd18c9fc92505.jpg><p>The actress’s <a href=#>upbringing</a> was quite tough, mainly because she was a&nbsp;fair-skinned kid with a&nbsp;Spanish name living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;predominately Latino neighborhood. This is&nbsp;one reason why other kids would make fun of&nbsp;her. Another reason was for her <strong>skinny figure</strong>, which earned her the nickname.</p><p>Did you have any funny or&nbsp;annoying nicknames while growing&nbsp;up?
