She mentioned that her boyfriend got furious when she broke up&nbsp;with him because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;trifle, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;thought. He&nbsp;just left the closet door open, and he&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was absolutely unfair on&nbsp;her end to&nbsp;end their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> because of&nbsp;it. But in&nbsp;her post, the woman gave her reasoning for&nbsp;it, and many people agreed with her decision after reading her story.</p><p><h2>The woman came to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;tell her extraordinary story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ee/16a/1318c85bd2be6e1f0a6f4e1ef8.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman, 24, wrote on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the subreddits and asked people for their opinions. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that her ex&nbsp;posted on&nbsp;another subreddit with the title «Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong for not wanting to&nbsp;close my&nbsp;girlfriend’s closet» and she just wanted a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;respond.</p><p>She said that her now ex-boyfriend, 23, and she, were together for 2&nbsp;years, would’ve been 3&nbsp;years next month. They met through a&nbsp;mutual friend (her roommate at&nbsp;the time) because of&nbsp;their similar interests.</p><p>She goes&nbsp;on, saying, «I’ve lived in&nbsp;my&nbsp;apartment for about 4&nbsp;years, the mutual friend stayed in&nbsp;the beginning, but they moved 3&nbsp;years ago, so&nbsp;since then I’ve been living on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own. I&nbsp;was originally going to&nbsp;have my&nbsp;bf&nbsp;move in&nbsp;with me&nbsp;once my&nbsp;lease ended, but of&nbsp;course, change of&nbsp;plans.»</p><p><h2>The woman’s ex&nbsp;didn’t mention the details of&nbsp;her “open door fear.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ff/9c7/6ae4c15d0394f94b790da6871e.jpg><p>The woman goes&nbsp;on, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «So&nbsp;my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;posted on&nbsp;another subreddit for leaving my&nbsp;closet door open, yet he&nbsp;missed very important details. One question that kept appearing was why didn’t I&nbsp;close the door, even though&nbsp;I never leave it&nbsp;open.»</p><p>The woman explained, «Ever since&nbsp;I was little, I’ve trained my&nbsp;brain to&nbsp;always make sure the closet door was closed. I’ll add a&nbsp;TW here just in&nbsp;case, but when&nbsp;I was 6, I&nbsp;was sharing a&nbsp;room with my&nbsp;older sister, one night she went over her friend’s house for a&nbsp;sleepover. My&nbsp;parents and&nbsp;I got home a&nbsp;bit late. I&nbsp;remember it&nbsp;being hot since we&nbsp;had the ac&nbsp;on. I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;bed but was tossing and turning because it&nbsp;was really hot. I&nbsp;kept hearing a&nbsp;noise from somewhere, but wasn’t sure from where, and just assumed it&nbsp;was the&nbsp;ac.»</p><p>She continues her story, saying, «I&nbsp;laid on&nbsp;my&nbsp;back just staring at&nbsp;the roof and heard my&nbsp;closet door being open. My&nbsp;bed was faced towards the closet, so&nbsp;when&nbsp;I moved my&nbsp;head down, I&nbsp;could see this old man coming out of&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;screamed, and my&nbsp;parents came running&nbsp;in. My&nbsp;dad grabbed me&nbsp;and&nbsp;I saw my&nbsp;mom hitting that man with one of&nbsp;her favorite pans. We&nbsp;called the police and later found out that the man was homeless, must’ve snuck in&nbsp;while we&nbsp;were away and hid in&nbsp;my&nbsp;closet when he&nbsp;heard my&nbsp;parents’ car come&nbsp;in.»</p><p><h2>The OP&nbsp;had a&nbsp;real trauma after what had happened to&nbsp;her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b9/f59/9e48ec5228bc39d07df2509342.jpg><p>The woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «Since then I’ve suffered from PTSD in&nbsp;fear of&nbsp;someone coming in&nbsp;my&nbsp;closet again. I&nbsp;slept with my&nbsp;parents for a&nbsp;few years after that. We&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;another state once&nbsp;I hit high school. Parents got me&nbsp;a&nbsp;therapist when the incident occurred and to&nbsp;this day, I’m still going to&nbsp;therapy.»</p><p>But she still has this fear, up&nbsp;to&nbsp;this day, and she believes it&nbsp;shouldn’t have been ignored.</p><p>She revealed, «I&nbsp;felt like it&nbsp;wasn’t working tho because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;just like&nbsp;I was venting, and the therapist would go&nbsp;„uh&nbsp;huh, and how does that make you feel?“ Instead of&nbsp;suggesting something to&nbsp;help&nbsp;me. That was until my&nbsp;current therapist, she suggested that&nbsp;I could use something like a&nbsp;nightlight and place it&nbsp;by&nbsp;the closet, then&nbsp;I asked if&nbsp;I use something else like something that could stick onto the walls.»</p><p>She explained what worked out for her, saying, «It&nbsp;was first these big glow in&nbsp;the dark Dino <a href=# title=stickers data-link=tag>stickers</a>. I&nbsp;felt kinda silly about it&nbsp;first when&nbsp;I did put it&nbsp;up&nbsp;but when&nbsp;I had my&nbsp;sleep paralysis, I&nbsp;was still scared but was now able to&nbsp;tell what was sleep and what wasn’t and gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;comfort. I&nbsp;changed the themes occasionally to&nbsp;dinos, planets, and now stars. For the past 7&nbsp;years, it’s worked for&nbsp;me.»</p><p><h2>But her boyfriend totally ignored her fear.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/974/ad5/79c1b55a3798bf4be9399175b1.jpg><p>The woman explained that her relationship with her boyfriend was really good, but he&nbsp;did a&nbsp;very cruel thing to&nbsp;her. He&nbsp;was totally aware that keeping the closet door never opened at&nbsp;night wasn’t her pure whim, but he&nbsp;didn’t believe her.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «On&nbsp;the night before we&nbsp;broke&nbsp;up: when he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;„test&nbsp;me“, I&nbsp;had the worst hallucinations since&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;teenager. I&nbsp;wake&nbsp;up, see the door open, and start to&nbsp;imagine the man&nbsp;I saw all those years ago. When I&nbsp;woke the next day it&nbsp;was around 4&nbsp;am, I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;move and started to&nbsp;cry immediately to&nbsp;a&nbsp;point where&nbsp;I couldn’t shred any more tears and apart from the migraine from crying too hard, I&nbsp;felt a&nbsp;numbness.»</p><p>He&nbsp;was deaf to&nbsp;all her fears and tears, and she wrote, «So&nbsp;when he&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;a&nbsp;few hours late&nbsp;I waited for him in&nbsp;the kitchen just honestly feeling tired, I&nbsp;didn’t yell just spoke in&nbsp;a&nbsp;monotone voice. I&nbsp;told him how&nbsp;I had one rule and that was to&nbsp;close the door, he&nbsp;got defensive, saying he&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I was lying about my&nbsp;<a href=# title=trauma data-link=tag>trauma</a> just to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;he&nbsp;would care for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;told him to&nbsp;leave while&nbsp;I thought things over. I&nbsp;never ignored him, and he&nbsp;never texted me&nbsp;the whole week.»</p><p>She doesn’t regret her decision now, saying, «But now&nbsp;I know for sure that there’s no&nbsp;saving this relationship. And you can get your stuff from your brother, I&nbsp;already told him what you did. So&nbsp;good luck. I’ll be&nbsp;moving in&nbsp;with my&nbsp;sister out of&nbsp;town, I’m not renewing my&nbsp;lease, I&nbsp;just want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with people who actually support&nbsp;me.»</p><p><h2>People of&nbsp;Reddit expressed their opinion on&nbsp;the woman’s actions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba3/fcd/11acab5815922ee6db3a409dd5.jpg><p>Wow.

Sleep paralysis much of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, mostly from teens and onwards, I’m 40&nbsp;now. But very scary 25&nbsp;years ago, when it&nbsp;was really not a&nbsp;thing that was ever talked about. I&nbsp;hadn’t heard of&nbsp;it&nbsp;until about 10&nbsp;years ago, and just thought it&nbsp;was something&nbsp;I dealt with.<br>But I&nbsp;have had similar experiences, specifically with the lucid dreaming, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;it&nbsp;not being a&nbsp;big deal at&nbsp;all when it&nbsp;happens now.»</p><p>Another person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, «Dude. A&nbsp;similar thing happened to&nbsp;me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;kid. Instead of&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;closet (I&nbsp;can’t even BEGIN to&nbsp;imagine how terrifying THAT horror film of&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation was). It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;naked homeless man outside my&nbsp;window.<br>It&nbsp;was bedtime, my&nbsp;curtains were open. He&nbsp;was just there, outside in&nbsp;the dark. Then he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;come in&nbsp;our house. To&nbsp;this DAY, I&nbsp;make sure all my&nbsp;curtains are shut when I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;bed.»</p><p>And another user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «Enjoy your life without that person in&nbsp;it! You deserve so&nbsp;much better than that, my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;put my&nbsp;glow in&nbsp;the dark stars on&nbsp;my&nbsp;ceiling when&nbsp;I realized&nbsp;I needed them. I&nbsp;hope you meet someone who is&nbsp;understanding and helpful to&nbsp;you, rather than tries to&nbsp;trigger you out of&nbsp;spite.»</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, whose life was also changed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;little insignificant (at&nbsp;first sight) thing, a&nbsp;tampon. She found it&nbsp;in&nbsp;her husband’s car, and the whole <a href=#>drama</a> ensued after.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZutcymnJ2hkamyrcWMnaymqJWZeq7FjJumsp6inrKvsIyana2domK1pnnLnp2tZZ2ueqS4zqycrWWUpLyzec6pnKdlaGaEeX%2BVaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./salma-hayek-56-spills-the-beans-on-her-beauty-routine-and-were-in-awe-of-how-gracefully-she-has-aged-810209.html><span>←</span><span>I Have No Botox, Salma Hayek, 56, Reveals Her Secrets to Aging Gracefully and Naturally</span></a>
