As a result, the series as a whole is suspended from RTL’s network mid-season.</strong></p><p>On January 15, The Voice of Holland faced indefinite suspension following a series of sexual misconduct and power allegations. Following confidential allegations, both RTL of Germany and iTV of the U.K. have shared they have launched an investigation. Both networks are taking these claims “very seriously.” Although this series doesn’t air on iTV, the U.K.-based company owns the show as a whole.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-of-holland-ends-season-12-after-two-episodes>The Voice of Holland Ends Season 12 After Two Episodes</h2><p>This show began it’s 12th season on January 7, but was soon shutdown. Coaches of the season included Ali B, Waylon, <a href=# class=broken_link>AGT alum Glennis Grace</a>, and Anouk. The show has two additional coaches, rapper Typhoon and season six winner Maan de Steenwinkel.</p><p>Since the sexual misconducts have surfaced, Anouk has resigned from her position. The Dutch singer/songwriter shared that she no longer wishes to be a part of a show where “people have systematically looked the other way.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CYMyuF_orJI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Coach Ali B was one of many accused of sexual misconduct. His lawyer confirmed that he has been reported to the Netherlands’ Public Prosecution Service for “sexually transgressive behavior” in relation to the show. The celebrity coach stated on social media that he is “100 percent” innocent. He acknowledged that the allegation is about something that happened in the past and is not true in his recent Instagram statement.</p><p>“No name has been given, nothing concretely. I can’t defend myself against that…” Ali B wrote in Dutch. “I haven’t gotten a call from the police yet, but I will cooperate. Once again, it’s not true and I’m confident it’s research that will erase it.”</p><p>Jeroen Rietbergen, the bandleader, is one of many cast members who have resigned since allegations surfaced. He left the series over the weekend after admitting that he had sexual contact with women involved in the show on Dutch news service ANP.</p><p>Rietbergen claims that he was not aware that he was abusing his position of power at the time. In his statement, he shared that the situation occurred many years ago and he has since received professional help. For more than a decade, the bandleader has been in a relationship with Linda de Mol, sister of one original owner of the series.</p><p>In the line of accusations, there is a third employee that is unknown so far. With an intense investigation underway there’s no way of knowing when this show will return to air, if it does. The networks are currently looking for the truth before they can air this show again.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1352583739.jpg alt="Luke Bryan “Could Not be Prouder” of Latest Video for His Single ‘Up’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice of holland</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmec6fZKGnnKGur7CMqaylpJWZeq61w2aqnpmjpLturcyim2arla3CoriMpqCsm5%2Bjsbav02aYnJulqK61tc6nqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwts-pros-daniella-karagach-pasha-pashkov-open-a-pizza-place.html><span>←</span><span>'DWTS' Pros Daniella Karagach, Pasha Pashkov Open a Pizza Place?</span></a>
