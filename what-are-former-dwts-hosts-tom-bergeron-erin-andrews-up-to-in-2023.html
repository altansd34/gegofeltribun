There’s no denying that Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews have been the most memorable. The two served as a hosting duo for 11 seasons, becoming constant fan-favorites because of their inimitable chemistry.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After the two ended their DWTS hosting journey, fans didn’t think there could be anyone better. It’s thus no surprise that even after their stint, many are curious about their next steps. It may not be possible for the duo to come back, but we definitely want to see them content and successful in their respective fields.</p><p>We roamed around social media to see how Bergeron and Andrews are doing this year. Here’s what we know so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tom Bergeron Now Actively Supports Writers’ Strike</h2><p>This year, Bergeron has passionately been advocating for writers’ rights. Along with other big stars, Bergeron is in full support of Writer’s Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA with their fight for fair TV and film contracts and proper compensation for employment on episodic television, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>As a manifestation of support, Bergeron spoke out and joined the picket lines during the 100th day of the WGA strike. He also decided to re-open submissions for fans to receive a video from him on Cameo to fund the advocacy.</p><p>“If you book a Cameo with yours truly, I will give 100% of my proceeds to support those striking for better wages, better conditions, for both SAG-AFTRA and the Writers’ Guild. Hope to talk to you!,” he said.</p><p>Nearly three years after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bergeron</a> was fired from DWTS, he said he’s “enjoying being a man of leisure.” In 2021, Bergeron revealed on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Here For You podcast</a> that his dismissal from the show was something he expected. According to him, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> that he left “was not the show that I loved.” Nevertheless, despite that he doesn’t see himself being on the show again, he clarified that he’s not at all retired from hosting.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-erin-andrews-is-busy-with-sportscasting-welcomed-first-baby>Erin Andrews is Busy with Sportscasting, Welcomed First Baby</h2><p>As for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrews</a>, she is currently working with FOX NFL for America’s Game of the Week. Specifically, Andrews contributes feature stories and sideline reports from the weekly national broadcast. Until present, the “America’s Sexiest Sportscaster” serves as an inspiration to many women who want to join the male-dominated field.</p><p>Furthermore, after multiple rounds of IVF and her cervical cancer diagnosis, Erin Andrews is now finally a first-time mom. Last July, she and her husband Jarret Stoll welcomed their son, Mack, via surrogate.</p><p>Opening up about her fertility journey, Andrews shared that both she and Stoll were in the delivery room during Mack’s birth.</p><p>“We’re so into sports in our family and we were cheering for her like she was our quarterback,” she said. “I’m kissing [the surrogate’s] head, and Jarret is looking like he just won the Stanley Cup again. It’s the perfect picture of surrogacy.”</p><p>Upon the successful process, Andrews is “paying it forward” sharing her personal story. This is the veteran sportscaster’s way to let others who are going through the same journey feel they’re not alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_LindsaySterling_Jeff-HahneGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Lindsey Stirling Announces Snow Waltz 2023 Christmas Tour in an Amusing Post" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWRp7Juss6rpJ6qXZnEtb%2BMoaasrKNiwbC5jJucq5%2BVp7yvecSroKdlkaOxs7HWrGSuqF2pvG61zWZpaWpjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tragic-things-that-have-happened-to-sofia-vergara.html><span>←</span><span>Tragic Things That Have Happened to Sofia Vergara</span></a>
