And one migrant Mexican family has found a&nbsp;brilliant way to&nbsp;teach their kids about the importance of&nbsp;hard work. And after graduating from <a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a>, their daughter paid a&nbsp;sweet <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>tribute</a> to&nbsp;her parents and shared their wisdom with the world.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>applaud all the hardworking families who are able to&nbsp;overcome life’s challenges and prove that the sky’s the limit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f34/081/a817db5a2f9dab5820c71d2dab.jpg><p>Jennifer Rocha’s parents came to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US from Mexico and never had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;pursue their dream of&nbsp;going to&nbsp;college. So&nbsp;they taught her that the only way to&nbsp;understand the importance of&nbsp;<a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> was to&nbsp;try working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;migrant farmer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/546/dad/379c3a50b9a2b00e747b2f9af3.jpg><p>After school, she was running to&nbsp;the fields to&nbsp;work there. Her family would finish late at&nbsp;night and wake up&nbsp;after just 2-3 hours of&nbsp;sleep. But it&nbsp;wasn’t just about physical labor and lack of&nbsp;sleep, Jennifer shared that she noticed how much <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> hard-working people deserve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33c/465/4483385c35bda8a8dd9c0d4dbf.jpg><p>People rarely realize what efforts are put into getting food into grocery stores. Behind something as&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;fruits and vegetables, there are people who sacrifice their health and work in&nbsp;inadequate conditions, enduring things like backaches and bugs that roam the farmers’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>faces</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a2/d39/dc0b4e583ba468913db9f92e00.jpg><p>During Jennifer’s college years, her family couldn’t afford to&nbsp;keep her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dorm, so&nbsp;she was juggling her studies, 2&nbsp;jobs, long commuting hours, and working in&nbsp;the field with her parents. “Many times&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;give&nbsp;up, but my&nbsp;parents and their pieces of&nbsp;advice and support were the reason&nbsp;I kept going.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd9/609/3947815cb88c64735a79dcc1ac.jpg><p>These photos are a&nbsp;tribute that Jennifer pays to&nbsp;her parents. Thanks to&nbsp;them, she was able to&nbsp;graduate and build strong character. And we’re sure that many of&nbsp;our readers will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;overcome all of&nbsp;life’s challenges like Jennifer and her family did!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/516/b0c/41b5d9568b989f0356adb2fed9.jpg><p>Have you ever overcome challenges in&nbsp;life?
