Adults were least likely to report using print newspapers (40%), online newsletters (40%) and podcasts for news (38%).</li><li class="mb-s last:mb-0"><strong>Democrats are nearly two times as likely as Republicans to trust the news media: </strong>Roughly a third of Republicans (31%), and about 3 in 5 Democrats (61%) said they have at least “some” trust in the news media, making it the most polarizing institution on <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer text-primary hover:underline" tabindex=0 href=#>Morning Consult’s Trust in U.S. Institutions Tracker</a>.</li><li class="mb-s last:mb-0"><strong>Tucker Carlson fans would rather watch the conservative host on his own media network than watch Fox News competitors: </strong>In the wake of Carlson’s firing and his show’s cancellation earlier this year, a larger share of his fans said they’d be interested watching him on his own network (75%) than the shares who said they’d be interested in tuning into him on social media (68%) or expressed interest in viewing a Fox News host who shares his opinions (65%).
