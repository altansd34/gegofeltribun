The little arrow beside the gas pump symbol on&nbsp;your dashboard. This might sound pretty obvious, but it’s there to&nbsp;tell you which side your gas tank is&nbsp;on. No&nbsp;more taking hours to&nbsp;remember&nbsp;it! The answer is&nbsp;right in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/22b/2ee/4e81365c5da3eec26e642e992f.png><p>The Winter season equals lots of&nbsp;hot chocolate and beautiful coats. They say people dress better in&nbsp;winter. I&nbsp;certainly agree. When it&nbsp;gets chilly out there, I&nbsp;take out all my&nbsp;warmest clothes. Have you wondered what the half-belt on&nbsp;your favorite winter coat means? Nowadays, it’s there just for an&nbsp;aesthetic function. But they were initially used to&nbsp;gather the extra cloth of&nbsp;jackets that doubled up&nbsp;as&nbsp;blankets. The belt was literally used to&nbsp;turn a&nbsp;blanket back into a&nbsp;jacket.</p><p>Now, there’s nothing more annoying than wearing your beautiful wool sweater and itching yourself through&nbsp;it. To&nbsp;keep this from happening again, here’s the secret. Turn your sweater inside out and soak it&nbsp;in&nbsp;cold water. Add two to&nbsp;three tablespoons of&nbsp;vinegar and let it&nbsp;sit for some time. Drain the water. Now, while the sweater is&nbsp;still wet, massage a&nbsp;generous amount of&nbsp;hair conditioner into the wool fibers. After letting it&nbsp;soak in&nbsp;the hair conditioner for about 30&nbsp;minutes, gently press the excess water out of&nbsp;the wool and leave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;dry flat on&nbsp;a&nbsp;towel. There you&nbsp;go, no&nbsp;more itchy sweaters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cf2/744/6f502459da9992ee2d2b694be5.png><p>It’s Friday night, and you have a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;friends over for hamburger night. You take out that delicious Heinz ketchup to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;even yummier when the patty is&nbsp;done! The ketchup seems stuck. No&nbsp;matter how hard you punch the bottle, it&nbsp;won’t come out. Your friend notices you and gives you a&nbsp;brilliant tip! Check out the 57&nbsp;marking on&nbsp;your ketchup bottle. Not the one in&nbsp;the logo. That doesn’t mean anything. But the one marked on&nbsp;the bottle indicates the best spot to&nbsp;squeeze to&nbsp;get your sauce out. It’s ketchup-palooza, everyone!</p><p>Women’s and men’s shirts have buttons on&nbsp;different sides. If&nbsp;that ever confused you, here’s the explanation. Shirt manufacturers back in&nbsp;the 13th Century started to&nbsp;place women’s buttons on&nbsp;the left side. Actually, buttons were a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;wealth. Most people tied their clothes with strips of&nbsp;cloth.<br>However, wealthier women had other people to&nbsp;dress them, such as&nbsp;chambermaids. Buttons on&nbsp;the left made it&nbsp;easier for women to&nbsp;be&nbsp;dressed by&nbsp;other women. This style traveled through time, and manufacturers continue to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/37c/2ee/6240b75ffb8ac562e950526d36.png><p>If&nbsp;you see cloudy ice on&nbsp;your drink, I&nbsp;will throw the whole thing out if&nbsp;I were you! Imagine you took a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;your local pizza place. As&nbsp;you arrive, your mouth is&nbsp;watering just to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;the free soda refill you’ll get. While waiting for your pizza, you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the soda machine. First thing first: you fill your cup with ice to&nbsp;the rim! You notice the ice is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit more cloudy than usual. Why is&nbsp;that, you think? Should you throw it&nbsp;all out or&nbsp;pour the soda anyway? Depending on&nbsp;how you freeze your ice, it&nbsp;freezes from the outside&nbsp;in. The first thing to&nbsp;freeze is&nbsp;the cleanest water. Minerals and impurities get pushed towards the middle of&nbsp;the cube, making the ice cloudy. In&nbsp;this case, go&nbsp;for the clear ice cubes. Clear ice means it’s only water. You’re less likely to&nbsp;have any troubles there! It&nbsp;will taste better. And it&nbsp;will last longer, keeping your drink colder for more time. The air stuck inside the cube will evaporate, and impurities melt sooner than the actual water, leaving you with tiny cubes of&nbsp;ice. In&nbsp;case you need good news: commercial ice machines tend to&nbsp;make clear ice cubes. Enjoy all you can drink!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e07/22d/9de9ac5beb8135e64579ffce9e.png><p>Keyboards weren’t always organized the way they are today. The first keyboards were made for typewriters. Remember typewriters? Anybody? Hmm. They were organized in&nbsp;alphabetical order. The A&nbsp;was right beside the&nbsp;B and the&nbsp;C and so&nbsp;on. So&nbsp;why is&nbsp;the system we&nbsp;know and have today called QWERTY? Originally, if&nbsp;you typed the keys too fast, the metal arms holding the letters would jam. The solution was to&nbsp;spread out commonly used letter pairs like “ST”. The top row ended up&nbsp;with the letters QWERTY, which allowed typists to&nbsp;actually type faster with far fewer jams.</p><p>Still used today. If&nbsp;you grew up&nbsp;off-roading, you’re probably used to&nbsp;seeing jerrycans around. They are super important when the gas in&nbsp;your tank is&nbsp;running out, and you are hundreds of&nbsp;miles from the nearest gas station. They can carry up&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;gallons of&nbsp;fuel. But have you ever wondered why jerrycans have three different handles? This peculiar feature was designed thinking about how heavy carrying fuel can get. If&nbsp;you’re alone, use the middle handle. It&nbsp;will distribute the weight better. But if&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;extra pair of&nbsp;hands, you can grab a&nbsp;handle on&nbsp;either side and carry it&nbsp;around. And would also mean that you’re a&nbsp;mutant. (Let’s give him another hand! Clap clap clap)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e99/72d/6ff5555e60918fd24b59455110.png><p>The little pocket inside women’s underwear is&nbsp;not really a&nbsp;pocket. It’s called a&nbsp;panty gusset. It&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra fabric that is&nbsp;sewn in&nbsp;for hygienic purposes. But most manufacturers don’t want to&nbsp;spend that extra buck sewing both ends of&nbsp;the fabric. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned into a&nbsp;pocket! And that’s all&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;say about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, did you ever check the inside of&nbsp;a&nbsp;soda cap? The glass bottle caps come with a&nbsp;special feature: a&nbsp;clear plastic liner. And&nbsp;no, they were not invented only to&nbsp;hand out prizes and reward codes. These plastic liners serve the purpose of&nbsp;keeping your drink fizzy! They are responsible for keeping the carbon dioxide inside the bottle. Way to&nbsp;go&nbsp;who thought of&nbsp;that! I&nbsp;love me&nbsp;some fizzy drinks.</p><p>Now, if&nbsp;you’re ever in&nbsp;need of&nbsp;pot scrubbers, try this. Whenever you buy oranges at&nbsp;the supermarket, don’t throw their mesh bag away. Keep it&nbsp;and make your own pot scrubber. You’ll just need to&nbsp;tie it&nbsp;up, and it’s ready. It&nbsp;will work great on&nbsp;your dishes and clean those dirty pots and pans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e20/76b/4dd8a95e47bcc4fbe2c67854c3.png><p>Say you’re out in&nbsp;public and need to&nbsp;use the restroom. Do&nbsp;you know which way those paper seat covers should&nbsp;go? Most of&nbsp;us place them backward. Because I&nbsp;think, this subject never came up&nbsp;in&nbsp;school. But they are actually made to&nbsp;go&nbsp;toward the front! This way prevents the cover from dragging along all those germs!</p><p>Don’t throw empty glass bottles away. Keep the ones with longer handles to&nbsp;water your plants. You just need to&nbsp;fill them with water and put them upside down into a&nbsp;planter. Push it&nbsp;gently into the soil and leave it&nbsp;there. The water will transfer into the pot as&nbsp;the soil becomes dry. Suitable for everyone who keeps forgetting to&nbsp;water their house plants!</p><p>Another pro indoor gardening tip. To&nbsp;keep the water from leaking at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;your plants, use a&nbsp;coffee filter. Place it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;your pot before adding the dirt and the plant. The filter will keep water from spilling out of&nbsp;the pot!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4a8/8f0/418cdf5eb28833c23ec8cbda26.png><p>Bread tie color guide. Try memorizing this before your next trip to&nbsp;the supermarket. Maybe you’ve noticed before, but bread bags carry little tags with different colors. Each tag color indicates the day of&nbsp;the week the bread was made. This helps store owners and consumers know how fresh the bread they’re buying&nbsp;is! Monday’s blue. Tuesday is&nbsp;green. Thursday is&nbsp;red. Friday is&nbsp;white, and Saturday is&nbsp;yellow! Sunday? Well, the baker needs a&nbsp;day off.</p><p>Can you resist the power of&nbsp;bubble wrap? Most people are highly seduced by&nbsp;bubble wrap&nbsp;— making it&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;stay around it&nbsp;for long periods. But did you know that bubble wrap was not invented initially to&nbsp;wrap things? A&nbsp;team of&nbsp;engineers and an&nbsp;inventor were trying to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;textured wallpaper. They tried sealing two shower curtains together to&nbsp;capture air bubbles, to&nbsp;give the wallpaper a&nbsp;raised surface. But the public didn’t buy their idea! It&nbsp;wasn’t until years later that they understood that Bubble Wrap was a&nbsp;perfect packaging material! Can we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;round of&nbsp;applause for this timeless invention? Or&nbsp;better yet, some bubble wrap pops?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLCtu9SdsGahk5p6pMHBnqpmoZ5ixrDB0Wabq6GeoHqlu82tZK2Zm5p6onnSoqdmcGFqfXR9jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brad-pitt-reveals-the-79-million-gift-he-gave-jennifer-aniston-on-her-50th-birthday-816316.html><span>←</span><span>Brad Pitt Reveals the $79 Million Gift He Gave Jennifer Aniston on Her 50th Birthday</span></a>
