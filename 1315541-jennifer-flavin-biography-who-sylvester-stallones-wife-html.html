They fell in love and started dating.</p><p class=align-left>The couple has had its own share of problems, one of which led to them breaking up in the '90s. As reported, Sylvester Stallone broke up with her via a 6-page letter that was delivered by FedEx.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d7ad4734f2c96de2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kara Royster’s biography: age, height, ethnicity, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Jenn was surprised by the breakup, as she did not see it coming. According to reputable sources, Stallone lied about the reasons for the breakup. Speaking about the breakup, she said:</p>“It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had no idea this was going to happen. We talked about us having children, about when I was going to get pregnant. We were already picking names, marking down names that he liked and I liked...I was disappointed. You can’t just write somebody off in a letter after six years. It’s not like I was going to try to beg him to come back to me or anything. I just wanted to talk.”<p class=align-left>One of Jenn's agents later informed her that the real reason why Stallone broke up with her was that a woman he was having an affair with had gotten pregnant with his baby. The woman's name was Janice Dickinson.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/163fe6ddaee6a84a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Chris Chan’s biography: what happened to the internet personality?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b5590526f8175b42.jpg><p class=align-left>As it later turned out, the baby was not Stallone's. In 1995, Sly and Jennifer got back together and rekindled their romance.</p><p class=align-left>They later got married on 17 May 1997. The Jennifer Flavin wedding ceremony consisted of:</p><ul><li>A civil ceremony held at the Dorchester Hotel in London, England</li><li>A chapel service held at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire</li></ul><p class=align-left>Before meeting Jenn, Stallone had been in two previous marriages. His first marriage lasted ten years. His first wife's name was Sasha Czack, and they got married on 28 December 1974. He allegedly cheated on his wife with Susan Anton, eventually ending the union in 1984.</p><p class=align-left>His second marriage was to Brigitte Nielsen. The union lasted for less than two years.</p><p class=align-left>Sylvester Stallone spouse once <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admitted to<i> People</i></a> that she could not escape the rumors about Sylvester’s infidelity:</p>“When we come together, it is wonderful. When we separate, there are no strings attached. That’s the way it is. No strings…I’m not naïve about what may go on when I’m not around – he is a 45-year-old man – I can’t change the way he is. Still, he’s not a cheating dog every day of the week. We spend five out of seven nights together, so I don’t know where he’d find the time.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/57a5beb08a976ffa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Susan Crow’s bio: All you need to know about Tony Bennett's wife</span></p></a><h2>Jennifer Flavin daughters</h2><p class=align-left>Who are the children who make up the Sylvester Stallone family?</p><p class=align-left>Jenn and Sylvester Stallone have three kids together.
