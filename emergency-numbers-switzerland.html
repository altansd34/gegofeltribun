Note that abusing the emergency response system is a punishable offense.</p><p>Switzerland has three official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">languages</a> on the national level: German, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French</a>, and Italian, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Romansh</a> as a fourth national language being only official in part. While not all helplines are available in all languages, the generic emergency number 112 (as well as other three-digit numbers) are available in the three official languages. For less urgent cases, you can reach out to local police as well as a variety of institutions and helplines. Further information and services are also available online.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jakob_02-1.jpg><h2>Jakob Straub</h2><p>Jakob is a freelance writer in Barcelona, Spain, and his favorite books have pages all empty.
