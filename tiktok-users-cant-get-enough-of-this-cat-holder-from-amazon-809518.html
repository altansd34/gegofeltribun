Their comical poses and the absurd way they are used just makes people smile.</p><p>Read the article to&nbsp;the end to&nbsp;discover even more products for your desk that will definitely surprise you with their creativity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc8/654/e33aa75932bf05290e1aff444b.jpg><p>So&nbsp;why is&nbsp;everyone so&nbsp;excited about these cats? What’s all the fuss about? It&nbsp;turns out they were designed to&nbsp;hold AirPods, but their purpose is&nbsp;limited only by&nbsp;our imagination. Customers have figured out many ways these cats can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;hold items ranging from all sorts of&nbsp;pens and jewelry to&nbsp;candles and pill jars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aae/35d/286b0e5ff99c2c44e6011051a7.jpg><p>These cats can provide hours of&nbsp;entertainment and briefly take you back to&nbsp;your childhood. You can choose from 5&nbsp;colors on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Amazon data-link=tag>Amazon</a> or&nbsp;get a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;5&nbsp;cats of&nbsp;all colors at&nbsp;once, which is&nbsp;very handy if&nbsp;you plan on&nbsp;making them work and hold things all around your house. They are made of&nbsp;plastic and measure 6&nbsp;cm&nbsp;/ 2.36&nbsp;inch. They can hold more weight than you might think.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb4/31f/9c3d0d5d3e9ebf2389543ab2ad.jpg><p>Here are a&nbsp;few scenarios where you can use these cats:</p><ul><li>They will be&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent gift for devoted cat lovers (those people who have the whole house covered with cats, a&nbsp;towel with a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat, a&nbsp;rug in&nbsp;the hallway in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat), so&nbsp;these figurines of&nbsp;cats will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great addition to&nbsp;their collection.</li><li>They can serve as&nbsp;funny decorations on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cake. It&nbsp;won’t take much time to&nbsp;decorate, but it&nbsp;will make your guests laugh out loud (just don’t let anyone eat them).</li><li>Keep these figurines near the table, so&nbsp;they can keep your spirit up&nbsp;while you work, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;help to&nbsp;hold a&nbsp;USB flash drive, pens, or&nbsp;money.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7a/21c/0e5cff52fba0e9bee996db1ef3.jpg><p>For more inspiration on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;use these cats, look them up&nbsp;on&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;— just search cat AirPods holder and cat pencil holder. There are dozens of&nbsp;these videos on&nbsp;TikTok, as&nbsp;people never stop finding new ways to&nbsp;use them, and the library of&nbsp;cat videos continues to&nbsp;grow.</p><p><strong>Check out these happy buyers’ reviews:</strong></p><ul><li><i><strong>The best thing I’ve ever bought, hands down.</strong> Had me&nbsp;howling when&nbsp;I was scrolling through the cat options of&nbsp;regular coat colors to&nbsp;stumble across 4&nbsp;black cats holding a&nbsp;coffin in&nbsp;the air!!! Hours of&nbsp;fun!!!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Noah&nbsp;R.</a></li><li><i><strong>Amazing product!</strong> This item is&nbsp;the best for cat lovers and is&nbsp;perfect for a&nbsp;gift. The quality is&nbsp;absolutely perfect, and it&nbsp;can hold AirPods. I&nbsp;recommend buying this cat figurine as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-quality, cheap gift for anyone who loves cats.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Buthayna Erdem</a></li><li><i><strong>I&nbsp;bought it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret Santa gift for an&nbsp;animal lover.</strong> She absolutely loved these cute little cats and said it&nbsp;was the best gift she’d ever had. Win! </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@debra kemp</a></li><li><i><strong>I&nbsp;love them!</strong> I&nbsp;did actually get them because they looked so&nbsp;cute, but they don’t hold anything. Although these do&nbsp;have a&nbsp;use (propping things&nbsp;up, etc.). They’re all sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;shelf, looking like they’re constantly celebrating! Hilarious! </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Ali</a></li><li><i><strong>Saw these on&nbsp;TikTok &&nbsp;no&nbsp;regrets about buying them.</strong> Super cute, they even have paw beans!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@lufu</a></li></ul><p><h2>Bonus: Don’t just stop at&nbsp;adorable kittens, because Amazon also has tons of&nbsp;fun and cute products that you can place on&nbsp;your desk.</h2></p><p><h2>1. Look at&nbsp;this adorable toddler Groot, who will gladly hold your gaming controller while you work, and in&nbsp;the evening, he&nbsp;will keep you company during your gaming sessions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfd/b13/60c6f25a8cb4a67bb3e962ae36.jpg><p>Fans of&nbsp;the <i>Guardians of&nbsp;the Galaxy &&nbsp;Marvel</i> will just love this Groot. He&nbsp;can hold not only a&nbsp;PlayStation gaming controller but also an&nbsp;Xbox, Nintendo Switch gaming controller, and&nbsp;TV remote. This holder is&nbsp;8″ tall.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><p><i><strong>So&nbsp;cute!</strong> My&nbsp;son uses this when charging his Nintendo Switch, phone, and Xbox controller, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;knows where it&nbsp;is. It’s very handy. </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>@</i>Shannon omalley</a></p><p><h2>2. If&nbsp;you think you’re busy multitasking, check out how this figurine struggles to&nbsp;hold both your pen and your tape at&nbsp;the same time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/55d/687/a076205ae08fa6d2b11cb16ec7.jpg><p>Instead of&nbsp;boring organizers, diversify your desk space with this holder for tape and various little things. It&nbsp;comes with a&nbsp;roll of&nbsp;tape, paper clips, a&nbsp;pen, and a&nbsp;sticky notepad. The funny thing is&nbsp;that this little man can be&nbsp;lifted&nbsp;up, and underneath, you will find paper clips. Surprise and amuse your colleagues with this purchase.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><p><i><strong>I&nbsp;bought this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;fun for my&nbsp;desk at&nbsp;home to&nbsp;encourage my&nbsp;creative side and keep things tidy.</strong> It&nbsp;is&nbsp;really useful for keeping all of&nbsp;your essential office equipment in&nbsp;a&nbsp;compact, fun, and organized way. The funniest bit is&nbsp;the paperclip storage in&nbsp;the loo part of&nbsp;the product itself. It&nbsp;has become such a&nbsp;feature of&nbsp;my&nbsp;desk that my&nbsp;girlfriend and&nbsp;I have named him Louis (hopefully, you get the pun!). This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very fun product with a&nbsp;purpose for every day at&nbsp;your desk.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Doughnut</a></p><p><h2>3. Let your inner child enjoy cute things, like this gum-shaped AirPods case. You’ll even love the fact that the case opens identically to&nbsp;the original gum package.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2b/88f/d153a15624b819c92561203a28.jpg><p>This case is&nbsp;suitable for AirPods 1&nbsp;and 2. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;silicone, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;will absorb the shock of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fall and protect them from dust. The case also has a&nbsp;cutout for charging the earbuds without having to&nbsp;take them out of&nbsp;the case.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><p><i><strong>Great product!!</strong> I&nbsp;absolutely love this product, I&nbsp;love the way it&nbsp;looks and the fact that it&nbsp;looks exactly like the bubble gum roll. I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;big fan of&nbsp;collecting different retro sweets&nbsp;— AirPods cases. I&nbsp;cannot fault this product, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;does what it’s supposed to&nbsp;and looks lovely when carrying them. </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Laura Moorsom</a></p><p><h2>4. Add a&nbsp;cute little doggie to&nbsp;the support group, and he’ll happily hold your glasses while you sleep. Don’t worry, your spectacles will be&nbsp;safe and secure with that adorable face.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ac/7d6/7bd46c5cf190162ff1abd68238.jpg><p>You’ll never lose your glasses again with this cute doggie holding them. This figurine is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;resin and measures 11&nbsp;cm x&nbsp;7&nbsp;cm. The bottom of&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;coated with a&nbsp;soft fabric so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;won’t slip off the table.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><p><i><strong>I&nbsp;highly recommend&nbsp;it!</strong> I&nbsp;bought this for my&nbsp;mom for her birthday, as&nbsp;she is&nbsp;always putting her glasses down, and she doesn’t remember where. She loved&nbsp;it! It’s a&nbsp;lovely little glasses holder, sturdy and arrived quickly. I’d definitely buy another one. </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Helena</a></p><p><h2>5. To&nbsp;reduce stress while working at&nbsp;your desk, add some ambient light. This bunny will be&nbsp;your must-have helper at&nbsp;night and will illuminate your desk with a&nbsp;subtle glow.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70e/7b3/a6797353a6a6f1c30d768d893e.jpg><p>This bunny lamp is&nbsp;portable, and you can place it&nbsp;wherever you want. It’s made of&nbsp;squishy silicone and holds a&nbsp;charge for 12&nbsp;hours, after which you need to&nbsp;charge it&nbsp;with the charger that comes with&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;party after a&nbsp;hard day’s work, just change the mode from simple lighting to&nbsp;16&nbsp;color-changing mode by&nbsp;tapping on&nbsp;it.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><p><i><strong>I&nbsp;love&nbsp;it! I&nbsp;was hesitant to&nbsp;buy it&nbsp;with the lack of&nbsp;reviews, but it’s just so&nbsp;cute!</strong> It&nbsp;has 2&nbsp;brightness settings and a&nbsp;rainbow setting that can be&nbsp;paused on&nbsp;one color. It&nbsp;took a&nbsp;while for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;get the hang of&nbsp;hitting it&nbsp;to&nbsp;change the setting. It&nbsp;requires a&nbsp;firm pat. Flicking an&nbsp;ear also works.</i><br><i>It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;turned off/on with a&nbsp;button on&nbsp;its base next to&nbsp;the charging slot.</i><br><i>It&nbsp;lasts me&nbsp;several nights before&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;recharge. </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Cat</a></p><p>Is&nbsp;there an&nbsp;item at&nbsp;your desk right now that makes you happy every time you look at&nbsp;it?
