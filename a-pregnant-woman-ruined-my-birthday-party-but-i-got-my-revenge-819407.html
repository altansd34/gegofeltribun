But in&nbsp;today’s story, everything took an&nbsp;unexpected turn when a&nbsp;pregnant woman stole the spotlight and turned one celebration into a&nbsp;chaotic disaster.</p><p>My&nbsp;birthday was yesterday and my&nbsp;husband invited his best friend, Matt, and his best friend’s pregnant girlfriend, Jane, out for a&nbsp;BBQ. They live 2&nbsp;houses down from&nbsp;us. It&nbsp;was only&nbsp;us, our 3&nbsp;children, and them (along with their 3&nbsp;kids).</p><p>I&nbsp;spent about $90&nbsp;on hamburgers and hotdogs. Matt also showed up&nbsp;with 2&nbsp;lbs of&nbsp;meat for hamburgers. While the guys <a href=# title=cooked data-link=tag>cooked</a>, I&nbsp;went swimming with all the kids in&nbsp;our pond. Jane sat near the guys on&nbsp;her phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b7/8d8/55a9eb55dabaa17bf0103f77cf.jpg><p>Around&nbsp;5:30 the guys called the kids over for food. My&nbsp;middle child (9) and&nbsp;I weren’t hungry yet, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;kept swimming. We&nbsp;spent a&nbsp;good 40+&nbsp;extra minutes in&nbsp;the water on&nbsp;our tubes. I&nbsp;wasn’t paying any attention to&nbsp;anything that was going on&nbsp;near the grill.</p><p>Around&nbsp;6:15, my&nbsp;husband said that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;store run, so&nbsp;I told my&nbsp;son that we&nbsp;should probably go&nbsp;eat now. My&nbsp;husband and Matt were gone by&nbsp;the time we&nbsp;got up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the grill, and so&nbsp;was Jane. Well, when we&nbsp;got up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the grill, the food was gone&nbsp;— all of&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffc/592/a878935a1694443952e9ec3772.jpg><p>I&nbsp;called my&nbsp;husband and asked him where all the food was, and he&nbsp;said that it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the grill. I&nbsp;told him that everything was gone. There was a&nbsp;long pause before he&nbsp;said, “Jane asked if&nbsp;she could take some for leftovers, but&nbsp;I didn’t think she would take all of&nbsp;it.” He&nbsp;then told me&nbsp;there were at&nbsp;least 8&nbsp;burgers and 10&nbsp;hotdogs left, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;macaroni salad, when he&nbsp;left for the store 10&nbsp;minutes prior.</p><p>I&nbsp;told him to&nbsp;call Matt and see where all the food was. He&nbsp;did. He&nbsp;then called me&nbsp;back and said that Matt claimed Jane only took “a&nbsp;few” and that they had already been eaten. But my&nbsp;oldest son (13) straight up&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;saw Jane walk off our property carrying the entire dish (one of&nbsp;those extra large tin foil BBQ dishes).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/788/141/4b09b05b529129011d21e4c70a.jpg><p>Anyway, I&nbsp;was pissed at&nbsp;this point. Neither I&nbsp;nor my&nbsp;son had eaten anything. My&nbsp;husband was also irritated, but he&nbsp;just grabbed for my&nbsp;son and me&nbsp;something from the store instead of&nbsp;making a&nbsp;huge fuss. I&nbsp;didn’t really blame him (both he&nbsp;and Matt work together, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;what it&nbsp;is).</p><p>Anyway, much to&nbsp;my&nbsp;surprise, Jane and her kids came back over 45&nbsp;minutes later and asked if&nbsp;they could have some of&nbsp;my&nbsp;cake. I&nbsp;told Jane that her kids could, but she couldn’t. She asked why, and I&nbsp;said, “I’m pretty sure you’ve eaten plenty, considering you took off with my&nbsp;entire BBQ dinner before my&nbsp;son and&nbsp;I could eat anything.”</p><p>She tried arguing that my&nbsp;husband told her she could have&nbsp;it, that “half of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was hers” (because they brought 2&nbsp;lbs of&nbsp;hamburger meat) and she “didn’t realize” my&nbsp;kid and&nbsp;I hadn’t eaten (she was beside the grill the entire time). I&nbsp;just shrugged my&nbsp;shoulders and walked away. She told her kids, “Let’s go,” and they left without cake. At&nbsp;this point, I&nbsp;felt like maybe I’d been a&nbsp;jerk. No&nbsp;one has said anything since, but&nbsp;I know there’s tension.</p><p><h2>People took her side.</h2></p><ul><li>“If&nbsp;the party is&nbsp;still going&nbsp;on, there aren’t leftovers yet, it’s just food.
