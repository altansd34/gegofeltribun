But no costume has been more mysterious than the Ladybug, who was just announced on Sunday. And even with the initial clues, it’s hard to say who’s behind the mask!</strong></p><p>Here are the clues and performances from the Ladybug so far.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVRfuu8WkUE</p>The Ladybug singing “Holding Out For A Hero” on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Premiere</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Clues On ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>The Ladybug started her <a href=#>first set of clues</a> on camera of an old-timey show on “KSOR.” She is seen standing next to a wheel, hosting a mock game show. She says “after a life time of drama,” she could really use love and luck. She was born into the limelight and her family feuds were public. But after years of spinning the wheel, being anonymous on the show feels like a “prize.” The Ladybug mentions luck many times, so that’s a potential clue. In a Southern accent, she also says she’s been through a lot in her life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Popular Guesses On ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>Nicole thinks she’s a trained singer and “recognized her tone,” but can’t figure out who it is. Robin guessed Lily Collins, Jenny guessed Willow Smith, and Ken guessed Lindsay Lohan. Jenny then thought it might be Jamie Lynn Spears. Fans online seem to agree most with Jenny’s guess of Jamie Lynn Spears. Ashlee Simpson, Kelly Osbourne, Paris Hilton, and Drew Barrymore have all been thrown out as options too. This is the one costume that has the audience and judges the most perplexed so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Our Prediction And Possible Spoilers</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, the Ladybug has maybe the hardest clues to decode so far. But if we have to predict someone, we’d say <strong>Kelly Osbourne</strong>. The first thing you may point out is that the Ladybug has a Southern drawl. Well, we have reason to believe that the accent is fake and the Ladybug is actually from the UK. Why? Because Robin Thicke said so himself in an interview with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>! Kelly definitely grew up in the limelight though, with her family’s show “The Osbournes.” And there were plenty of “family feuds” and drama along with that.</p><p>Now, many of the prizes on the fake game show relate to the Osbournes too. Her mom Sharon is famous for throwing a ham, which was depicted and she used to manage The Smashing Pumpkins. Her dad Ozzy is also known for skulls and doing things with bats, which were both shown as well. Kelly herself loves dogs, has been a fashion judge on TV, and is a Scorpio. And the photo of the bridge represents London, where they’re from. So that explains…basically all of the hints we got.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>‘The Masked Singer’ has captivated America, and it isn’t hard to see why. The elaborate costumes, the performances, and the big mystery behind the identities of its celebrity competitors had America invested and committed to finding out who each contestant really is. With that said, here are all the reveals from Season 1.</figure><p>If you want to know more about the other costumes on The Masked Singer, here’s where you can check out our other “Spoilers, Clues & Predictions” pages: <a href=#>Butterfly</a>, <a href=#>Thingamajig</a>, <a href=# class=broken_link>Skeleton</a>, <a href=#>Rottweiler</a>, <a href=# class=broken_link>Tree</a></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Benicio-Bryant-AGT-singing.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Star Benicio Bryant Drops New Song ‘Poison’ Thanks To — Math?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZyWsbqu1KBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6505-why-has-john-lewis-twitter-activity-increased.html><span>←</span><span>What is behind John Lewis' increased Twitter activity?</span></a>
