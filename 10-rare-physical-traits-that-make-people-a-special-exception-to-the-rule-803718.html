We&nbsp;are not only different from other species, but also from each other. Now, within these characteristics and traits that define human beings, some are infrequent, rare, and in&nbsp;some cases, extraordinary.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;analyzed different characteristics of&nbsp;the human body and discovered 11&nbsp;that are very rare. Check them out now, and then tell&nbsp;us if&nbsp;by&nbsp;some strange chance you possess any of&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>1. Green eyes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f3/b9b/b1cb675332954f0953cb886f4a.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Eye color</a> is&nbsp;determined by&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;melanin there&nbsp;is, which is&nbsp;the same pigment responsible for hair and skin color. Brown is&nbsp;the most common color; more than <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>half</a> of&nbsp;the world’s population has brown eyes. The high level of&nbsp;melanin helps protect people from the sun’s harmful rays. This explains why brown eyes are more common in&nbsp;warmer climates than in&nbsp;colder ones, where protective pigments are not as&nbsp;necessary.</p><p>Gray and green eyes are the least <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>common</a>; green eyes are, in&nbsp;fact, the rarest. Only&nbsp;3% of&nbsp;the world’s population have gray eyes, while only&nbsp;2% have green eyes. These shades are due to&nbsp;the low amount of&nbsp;melanin present in&nbsp;the iris. When this pigment is&nbsp;absent, so&nbsp;is&nbsp;the brown color.</p><p><h2>2. Widow’s peak</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c8/10b/9be6a458a1947419aaeee9c171.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>widow’s peak</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;V-shaped point in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the forehead formed by&nbsp;the hairline. It&nbsp;has this name because this is&nbsp;the way women in&nbsp;Victorian times wore their hats as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;mourning.<br>An&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>investigation</a> of&nbsp;this trait found it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare feature. Of&nbsp;the total number of&nbsp;people observed, 67% did not have a&nbsp;widow’s peak, and&nbsp;33% did. It&nbsp;appears that genes, age, and sex are variables that influence this trait.</p><p><h2>3. Wisdom teeth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c72/017/51580f558fae841af03e5b8108.jpg><p>Most people reach adulthood having their wisdom teeth extracted. This is&nbsp;because when they come out, around adolescence, they generally do&nbsp;not have enough space to&nbsp;grow in&nbsp;the right way, either because the jaw is&nbsp;too small or&nbsp;simply because the mouth is&nbsp;already full of&nbsp;teeth.</p><p>Due to&nbsp;the lack of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>space</a>, these molars can grow sideways, emerge only partially from the gums, or&nbsp;get trapped between the gums and the jawbone and generate infections; which leaves&nbsp;us no&nbsp;choice but to&nbsp;extract them. A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> done on&nbsp;people between 18&nbsp;and 38&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age showed that in&nbsp;an&nbsp;18-year period, only&nbsp;31% kept these teeth; and this number decreased even more in&nbsp;the following years.</p><p><h2>4. Palmaris longus muscle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/870/72f/a8851c5055842b3b38163f534a.jpg><p>To&nbsp;find out if&nbsp;we&nbsp;have this tendon or&nbsp;not, it’s enough to&nbsp;press the thumb and the little finger against each other and look at&nbsp;the wrist. This protuberance that, in&nbsp;some cases, is&nbsp;seen is&nbsp;the palmaris longus. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;said to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>evolutionary</a> remnant that we&nbsp;inherited from our ancestors who needed the strength of&nbsp;this tendon to&nbsp;climb trees.</p><p>However, today its presence or&nbsp;absence does not make&nbsp;us any stronger; nor does it&nbsp;give&nbsp;us a&nbsp;better grip. In&nbsp;spite of&nbsp;this, only&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>14%</a> of&nbsp;people are missing this protrusion when they press their fingers together, and this is&nbsp;more the case for women than for men. However, this percentage may vary in&nbsp;African, Asian, and Native American populations.</p><p><h2>5. A&nbsp;small hole near the ear</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/504/046/2f00fc5f7ba6ce8bc58118738b.jpg><p>It’s officially known as&nbsp;the preauricular sinus, is&nbsp;shaped like a&nbsp;nodule, dent, or&nbsp;dimple, and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare feature of&nbsp;the body. It’s located just in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the ear and above the ear canal and generally occurs on&nbsp;only one side. Although its frequency varies between <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>populations</a>, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;most commonly seen in&nbsp;Asian and African populations and, even then, does not exceed 10%.</p><p>Like the tendon in&nbsp;the wrist, some theories suggest this is&nbsp;an&nbsp;evolutionary remnant. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Studies</a> along these lines claim that our ears evolved from ancestral fish, whose ability to&nbsp;hear would be&nbsp;based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;brachial opening that would seem to&nbsp;resemble this particular dimple in&nbsp;the human ear.</p><p><h2>6. Double row of&nbsp;lashes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c50/429/ff403c5b8a8d35c1e7f5d2a0c8.jpg><p>This extra row of&nbsp;eyelashes is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare trait and is&nbsp;medically identified as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>distichiasis</a>. Although it&nbsp;may seem like every woman’s dream at&nbsp;first glance, it’s actually a&nbsp;condition that involves the abnormal growth of&nbsp;eyelashes into the openings of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>meibomian glands</a>, the sebaceous glands distributed along the edge of&nbsp;the eyelid.</p><p>This misplaced growth at&nbsp;the thin edge of&nbsp;the skin closest to&nbsp;the eye can cause the eyelashes to&nbsp;rub against the eyeball, causing irritation and frequent tearing, among other possible complications.</p><p><h2>7. Outer navel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66e/6ad/583de65b5fb74e2ecddb4faff8.jpg><p>A&nbsp;study shows that only&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>4%</a> of&nbsp;adults have an&nbsp;external navel. Several reasons determine what kind of&nbsp;belly button we&nbsp;will have as&nbsp;adults, and none of&nbsp;them are related to&nbsp;the way our umbilical cord was cut at&nbsp;birth; although it&nbsp;is&nbsp;commonly believed that this is&nbsp;the cause.</p><p>The navel is&nbsp;basically the scar that remains after the small piece that was left after the umbilical cord was cut falls off, approximately 2&nbsp;weeks after birth. The way our skin grows as&nbsp;this scar heals will determine the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shape</a> of&nbsp;the belly button.</p><p><h2>8. One pupil larger than the other</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/722/c53/c61673507ba8602b9626fb9fe9.jpg><p>Pupils <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>change</a> their size to&nbsp;regulate the amount of&nbsp;light that enters the eye. That’s why they become large in&nbsp;the dark and become smaller when there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;natural light. In&nbsp;general, the pupils of&nbsp;each eye dilate or&nbsp;contract at&nbsp;the same time, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few cases, this is&nbsp;not the norm, so&nbsp;they appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;different sizes in&nbsp;each eye.</p><p>This mismatch between pupil sizes is&nbsp;medically known as&nbsp;anisocoria. In&nbsp;cases where it&nbsp;occurs naturally, the difference between one pupil and the other is&nbsp;generally always the same. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Studies</a> show that only 15%-30% of&nbsp;the population experience this.</p><p><h2>9. Uncombable hair syndrome</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9e/5db/8f6c8c505aaa09cfe9569a1c3e.jpg><p>It’s actually called non-combable hair syndrome and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;condition characterized by&nbsp;dry, frizzy hair that cannot be&nbsp;combed. It&nbsp;occurs in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>childhood</a>, usually in&nbsp;the first years of&nbsp;life, but can appear up&nbsp;to&nbsp;12&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age. It&nbsp;does not grow downward, but outward, and in&nbsp;multiple directions. It’s typically light or&nbsp;golden in&nbsp;color.</p><p>Despite its appearance, this type of&nbsp;hair is&nbsp;not fragile or&nbsp;brittle and grows at&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal or&nbsp;slightly slower rate. In&nbsp;adolescence, it&nbsp;generally improves in&nbsp;appearance and becomes straight and normal in&nbsp;texture.</p><p><h2>10. Morton’s finger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/175/b75/3571285657a620fe1491ed3379.jpg><p>Morton’s toe or&nbsp;Morton’s foot is&nbsp;the structure of&nbsp;the foot in&nbsp;which the second toe is&nbsp;longer than the first toe. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>type</a> of&nbsp;foot is&nbsp;the least frequent worldwide, and according to&nbsp;the surrounding population, its prevalence varies between approximately&nbsp;3% and&nbsp;22%.</p><p><h2>11. Red hair and blue eyes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fd/29e/4c28465797b4bdff3d66c27533.jpg><p>Among the possible natural hair colors, darker locks are the most common. It’s estimated that&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>90%</a> of&nbsp;the world’s population has brown or&nbsp;black hair. On&nbsp;the opposite side of&nbsp;the spectrum is&nbsp;red hair; only&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1% to&nbsp;2&nbsp;%</a> have red hair.</p><p>Equally rare, though not as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>common</a> as&nbsp;red hair, are blue eyes. While these 2&nbsp;traits are uncommon in&nbsp;both men and women, research shows that reddish hair is&nbsp;more common among <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>women</a> and light blue eyes, among <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>men</a>.</p><p>What attitudes or&nbsp;behaviors of&nbsp;yours do&nbsp;you think make you different from the rest?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedGaqZ5loJ3GtLXCmqNmrKKWtrW%2FjK2fmqxdoq6ssYypnKionJp6onnSqZycoZGheqbEwp6nraGfo3q1u4ytn55loqq5pnmXaWpwaWhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-can-see-your-voice-announces-episode-2-celebrity-guests-gavin-degraw-jennie-garth-more.html><span>←</span><span>'I Can See Your Voice' Announces Episode 2 Celebrity Guests Gavin DeGraw, Jennie Garth, More!</span></a>
