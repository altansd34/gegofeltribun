The streaming service plans to release a new show called Building the Band, which aims to create a new music group without the members meeting face-to-face.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-netflix-to-launch-new-music-competition-series>Netflix to Launch New Music Competition Series</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Building the Band would bring together 50 singers to compete for the chance to form a band. These contestants would not see each other at first, and would instead have to rely on their musical abilities.</p><p>“It’s going to be an interesting social experiment paired with a singing competition,” Netflix’s Jeff Gaspin told the outlet. “At Netflix, we like to twist it a little bit so it’s not just completely straightforward, it’s not like a show you’ve seen elsewhere.”</p><p>The show is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">being described</a> as “Love Is Blind meets The Voice.” For those who may not know, Love Is Blind is a Netflix dating show in which contestants try to find their match without ever seeing each other face-to-face.</p><p>The Voice also takes a “blind” approach to the singing competition format, as the coaches cannot see the contestants when they first audition. They have to judge the artists solely on their voice before deciding if they want to work with them.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SOFIA VERGARA IS BEING SUED BY GRISELDA BLANCO’S ESTATE OVER NETFLIX SHOW</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-streamer-is-venturing-into-bigger-formats>The Streamer Is Venturing Into ‘Bigger Formats’</h2><p>You might associate Netflix with original movies and series on par with cable. But the streaming service is venturing into content that can compete with the major broadcast networks. Netflix’s reality boss Jeff Gaspin has experience with this.</p><p>“The difference from the past is we want to focus on bigger formats, more of what you would call broadcast-style shows versus the cable style shows,” Gaspin told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>. “I’ve done both in my career from running NBC to running Bravo, so I’m familiar with both and I really do understand the difference.”</p><p>Gaspin said Netflix aims to “have a very broad variety of things that people watch and love,” since they’re catering to around 650 million people worldwide.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Original_AGTKeyArt_NBCUniversal-220x147.jpg alt="10 ‘AGT’ Performances That Live Rent Free in My Mind" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zZ6rn6SZrXq1u4ylmK6mk516r7HWZqSuq5mYeqS7zKmcraGknryvedKeqaKdo2KvtrXLnaCnn12ptaZ5wZqlnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./my-husband-was-hiding-his-best-friend-from-me-i-found-out-why-and-im-livid-818343.html><span>←</span><span>My Husband Was Hiding His Best Friend From Me, I Found Out Why, and Im Livid</span></a>
