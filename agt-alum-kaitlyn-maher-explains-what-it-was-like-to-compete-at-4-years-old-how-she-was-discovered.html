As the youngest ever finalist on the show, at just four years old, she captured the hearts of millions with her angelic voice and charming personality. Recently, Maher shared a video on TikTok detailing her experience on the show, including how she got discovered and what it was like to become a finalist.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kaitlyn-maher-shares-her-incredible-journey-on-agt>Kaitlyn Maher Shares Her Incredible Journey On AGT</h2><p>Have you ever wondered how someone as young as four years old could make it onto one of the biggest talent shows in the world? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaitlyn Maher</a>‚Äòs story is one of those incredible tales that shows that sometimes, life can be unpredictable.</p><p>Maher recently posted a video on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> that takes viewers through her journey on AGT. She revealed that her AGT journey began with a simple request from a family member. The request was to sing Happy Birthday at a family reunion in Canada. Her mother was too sick to attend, so they decided to record a video of Maher singing the song and upload it to YouTube.</p><p>Six months later, Maher‚Äôs parents received an email from someone claiming to be an NBC casting producer. The sender asked if she would like to audition for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a>. However, the email was poorly formatted and misspelled the word ‚Äúaudition,‚Äù which made Maher‚Äôs parents suspicious.</p><p>However, it turned out that the email was legitimate, and Maher was indeed invited to audition for the show. Maher‚Äôs parents were initially hesitant about letting their young daughter audition for AGT. They worried that the experience would be too overwhelming and scary for her. However, Maher was determined to pursue her dream of performing on the show.</p><a title=@kaitlynmaherofficial href=# rel=noopener>@kaitlynmaherofficial</a> AGT was so incredibly transformative for me and i hope this story inspires you as much as it has meüíó <a title=agt href=# rel=noopener>#agt</a> <a title=americasgottalent href=# rel=noopener>#americasgottalent</a> <a title=agtauditions href=# rel=noopener>#agtauditions</a> <a title=americasgottalentaudition href=# rel=noopener>#americasgottalentaudition</a> <a title=actor href=# rel=noopener>#actor</a> <a title=auditionstory href=# rel=noopener>#auditionstory</a> <a title=storytime href=# rel=noopener>#storytime</a> <a title=grwm href=# rel=noopener>#grwm</a> <a title=miracle href=# rel=noopener>#miracle</a> <a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Kaitlyn Maher" href=# rel=noopener>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Kaitlyn Maher</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She is Still The Youngest Contestant That Has Reached The Finals On AGT</h2><p>It‚Äôs worth noting that Maher remains the youngest finalist ever to appear on the show to this day. While some contestants have come close to breaking this record in subsequent seasons, none have managed to achieve the same level of success at such a young age.</p><p>She even made it to the Top Ten but was ultimately eliminated. However, her journey didn‚Äôt end there. A few weeks later, the producers of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> called Maher‚Äôs parents and asked if she could attend the final show. To be a part of a big number with all the finalists. This was a dream come true for Maher, who had always wanted to see the sparkles or confetti fall down on the stage during the finale.</p><p>As fate would have it, Maher‚Äôs dream did come true. During the season finale, the winner was announced, and Maher was asked to run out onto the stage. She was then picked up by the winner, who held her in his arms as the sparkles fell down around them. This was a truly magical moment for Maher, and it was the perfect ending to her incredible journey on AGT.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/amanda-golden-buzzer-220x147.jpg alt="Trish Stratus Hits ‚ÄòCanada‚Äôs Got Talent‚Äô Golden Buzzer for Unique Dance Group" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZpmcqrput8Ciq6WxnmK6orTEq2SesKChrqq60mauoZmkYra1edaaqmakmaCybsDOZpqopaCawaZ5wK1kbWWpmq6zv4yoo51lmKTEbr%2FHnmSwmaNisaq%2FwqitnqqVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-he-ok-tom-hanks-shocks-fans-in-new-look-fans-are-worried-819329.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>''Is He Ok?''
