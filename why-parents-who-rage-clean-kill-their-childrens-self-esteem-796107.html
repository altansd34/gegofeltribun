Surprised guests or&nbsp;happy child</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b6/e2f/cab56c510fa7f7c00d9427f9e0.jpg><p>A&nbsp;rage-cleaning mother usually <a href=#>appears</a> on&nbsp;the day guests are arriving. Children come home from school and see that she is&nbsp;nervously washing dishes, and at&nbsp;the same time sweeping the floor, wiping away dust, and throwing things away&nbsp;— which before, didn’t bother anyone. She screams and demands that they immediately do&nbsp;all their household chores. Interestingly enough, this is&nbsp;all usually being done in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house that is&nbsp;never perfectly clean. Doesn’t this mean that everything is&nbsp;done in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make the guests say “wow”?</p><p>The children hardly understand what they are guilty of&nbsp;or&nbsp;why so&nbsp;much is&nbsp;being asked of&nbsp;them on&nbsp;that day. This makes them feel stressed and panicked. The children think that the guests are more important for their parents than they are and dinner might not be&nbsp;as&nbsp;enjoyable anymore, at&nbsp;least for them.</p><p><h2>2. The child can develop negative associations with you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2f7/ae2/c512e559b894fd31f94ab878b0.jpg><p>This feeling can become habitual for children. When it&nbsp;happens the second, third, and fourth time&nbsp;— a&nbsp;reflex will soon develop. The children may always have a&nbsp;terrible feeling that they didn’t put something in&nbsp;its place and will now be&nbsp;scolded.</p><p><h2>3. Rage-cleaning makes children unsure about things.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa4/cf7/ee5b94565aa2c5519dadb6170d.jpg><p>Parental support is&nbsp;important for children. If&nbsp;you want them to&nbsp;think that they are the best, just constantly tell them that. This rule can also work in&nbsp;the opposite way. So, a&nbsp;seemingly harmless bout of&nbsp;rage-cleaning might destroy a&nbsp;child’s self-esteem. After all, if&nbsp;your parents are pressing you for no&nbsp;reason, then what can you expect from the outside world?</p><p><h2>4. The child can also feel uncomfortable around company.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/71d/3dd/b69dec5b5587ecf2b31c36a4f9.jpg><p>Children often compare everything about their lives with others. They are always very pleased to&nbsp;know that they are the most loved. Once they stay overnight at&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend’s house and realize that no&nbsp;one <a href=#>in&nbsp;other families</a> is&nbsp;forced to&nbsp;always have a&nbsp;perfectly clean house. Yes, they also help around the house and do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;household chores, but this doesn’t turn into paranoia.</p><p><h2>5. Children, parents, and grandparents&nbsp;— rage-cleaning affects everyone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b34/bfa/e96d185275a5ecebf4ef2b3c89.jpg><p>A&nbsp;rage-cleaning mom often turns into a&nbsp;rage-cleaning grandmother. Generation after generation, new kids might experience the same<a href=#> problem</a>. The easiest way to&nbsp;solve this is&nbsp;to&nbsp;tell your mom that you appreciate her help, but that you’re trying something different. People also have many other tips about how they <a href=#>deal</a> with this misunderstanding. They might be&nbsp;useful for those who have been rage-cleaning or&nbsp;have been taught to&nbsp;rage-clean their entire life.</p><p><h2>6. Cleaning can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;pleasure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfd/088/d2d16557e8b43b0be3c6098b4b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;live as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rage-cleaner, you should organize a&nbsp;long-term cleaning schedule. For example, <a href=#>divide</a> your household chores by&nbsp;frequency of&nbsp;completion into daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly tasks. You can also divide the apartment into areas of&nbsp;responsibility between family members, including your children. These simple tips can help you always live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean house and not expend much effort on&nbsp;keeping it&nbsp;clean.</p><p>Did your mom ever turn into a&nbsp;rage-cleaning woman?
