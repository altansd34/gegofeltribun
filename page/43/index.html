When we’re kids, we&nbsp;think that, when we&nbsp;grow&nbsp;up, we’ll get the opportunity to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what we&nbsp;really want. However, in&nbsp;reality, everyone around&nbsp;us turns out to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;our life&nbsp;— parents demand we&nbsp;give them grandchildren, and friends give&nbsp;us advice on&nbsp;opening our own business. At&nbsp;the same time, the manufacturers of&nbsp;various goods want&nbsp;us to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;leopard print skirt and own the latest tech this season. And every other person is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us how we’re supposed to&nbsp;live because “it’s important” or&nbsp;“everybody does&nbsp;it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Woman Didnt Allow Her Second Husband to Punish Her Daughter, and He Decided to Take Revenge on</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>

Recently, a&nbsp;man asked online users about whether he&nbsp;had done the right thing by&nbsp;stopping performing his parental responsibilities. This decision was caused by&nbsp;the following situation: his wife told him that since he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;biological father of&nbsp;her children (from the first marriage), he&nbsp;doesn’t get a&nbsp;say in&nbsp;any punishment even if&nbsp;they did something bad. Here is&nbsp;the story told by&nbsp;himself.
The man’s story

Grocery stores, drug stores and even libraries boast racks of celebrity gossip magazines, with titles such as “Star,” “People” and “Us Weekly” lining the shelves. But despite these publications having a large reach, some of them have seen a decline in readership in recent years, and a new Morning Consult/The Hollywood Reporter poll shows that a plurality of adults don’t think highly of the paparazzi, whose work fills the pages of these magazines.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Being Married for 37 Years, Jamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest Sum Up Their Relationship Advice</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>

Marriage is&nbsp;about love and romance, but it&nbsp;also takes commitment and hard work when it&nbsp;isn’t smooth sailing. Jamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest have had a&nbsp;long and solid marriage. But even though they have been together for 37&nbsp;years, they know it&nbsp;takes work to&nbsp;keep a&nbsp;marriage happy. And surely, in&nbsp;their decades together, they have learned a&nbsp;bit about what makes a&nbsp;successful and lasting marriage.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side believe that marriages stay strong according to&nbsp;the decisions both partners make to&nbsp;commit to&nbsp;them.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Beyonce's 5 BIGGEST Photoshop Fails That Will Leave You Disappointed!</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>

The consumer electronics industry hasn’t been insulated from the COVID-19 crisis. Retailers are thinking about how to survive – and thrive – in a period where consumer confidence has cratered, high street mainstays are going into administration, and even companies that appear robust are facing great uncertainty.
Dixons Carphone, for example, recently decided to permanently close all of its 531 standalone Carphone Warehouse stores on April 3rd. Citing changes in the mobile market as well as coronavirus, the organisation announced that all services would be sold at the group’s Currys PC World locations.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cuba Gooding, Jr. popularity &amp;amp; fame</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>
