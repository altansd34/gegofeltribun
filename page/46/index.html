We&nbsp;don’t know who the first person was to&nbsp;notice that these caterpillars are “wearing” penguins on&nbsp;their backs, but we&nbsp;are thankful for this discovery.

Here at&nbsp;Bright Side we&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea that insects could look this fancy. Please meet the tent caterpillar in&nbsp;all its glory!
The family of&nbsp;tent caterpillars has different species which boast a&nbsp;great variety of&nbsp;colors and patterns.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tout le vocabulaire mdical utile en anglais</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>
