Alongside polite phrases to say please, thank you and sorry in French, saying hello is one of the most fundamental greetings, that you will need to use several times a day, each day of the week. But fundamental doesn’t necessarily mean easy. Depending on the context, the time of day and your relation with the person you’re talking to, you have several words and phrases to choose from. Just like failing to correctly faire la bise (kissing when saying hello or goodbye in France), using the wrong word may be a major faux pas.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>8 Scenes From Our Favorite Movies Where the Actors Emotions Were Actually Real</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>
