The public and MPs are also out of step when it comes to allowing assisted suicide for non-terminally ill patients suffering from painful incurable diseasesBack in 2019, a YouGov study on left and right wing beliefs showed that support for assisted dying was the nation’s most closely bipartisan view.
Now new YouGov research shows that there is overwhelming public support for doctor-assisted suicide for patients suffering from a terminal illness, but that MPs are heavily divided on this issue.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Twenty One Pilots popularity &amp;amp; fame</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

<a href=../../warrens-proposed-tax-on-wealthy-draws-more-support-than-ocasio-cortezs.html></a>
Taxing the wealthy has become a progressive rallying cry as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have proposed legislation to impose levies on the richest people in the country as a way to battle economic inequality. Between the two proposals, Warren’s wealth tax is the more popular among voters, according to a new Morning Consult/Politico survey. Sixty-one percent of the 1,993 voters surveyed in the Feb. 1-2 poll favored Warren’s “ultra-millionaire” plan, which is an annual tax of 2 percent on household wealth more than $50 million and a 3 percent levy on wealth in excess of $1 billion.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>When to use informal and formal German- Lingoda</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

Germans have a reputation of being serious and quite reserved, which you can also see in the language… and what shall I say?! In this case, the cliché is correct. The Scandinavians, for example, deliberately ignore their formal “you” or they keep it reserved for their royals. The English don’t even have to bother thinking, even if they accidentally run into the Queen on their way back home from the pub; it’s&nbsp;you-case closed.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is the Royal Hen?
