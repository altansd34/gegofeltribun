The latest trend in&nbsp;fashion might just be&nbsp;for a&nbsp;daring few. Famous people are leaving their pants at&nbsp;home (on&nbsp;purpose) and creating stylish looks with just underwear as&nbsp;bottoms. From donning just panties or&nbsp;briefs, with or&nbsp;without stockings, we&nbsp;admire their confidence! See for yourself their bold looks.
The “no-pants” trend is&nbsp;taking the celebrity world by&nbsp;storm.
A&nbsp;nightmare for some but a&nbsp;fashion statement for others, the disappearance of&nbsp;pants from runway looks happened gradually, with some pointing to&nbsp;the bike-shorts trend as&nbsp;the start of&nbsp;it&nbsp;all.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Former 'DWTS' Host Tom Bergeron Approves of the New Hosting Duo</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>

<a href=../../18443-four-ten-millennials-have-no-pension-provision.html></a>
Four in ten millennials have no pension provision, new research from YouGov reveals.
The Bridging the Young Adults Pension Gap report indicates that 44% of 18-34 year-olds say they have no pension provision whatsoever compared to around a fifth of 35-54s (22%) and over-55s (20%).
YouGov’s study reveals the extent to which under-35s have poor knowledge of pensions. Approaching three in ten (27%) say they simply don’t understand enough about them in general and even millennials who have a pension aren’t always clear about what it entails – with 14% who do have one not knowing what type it is.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Greys Anatomy Cast Changed Since the Series Release</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>

When you see somebody else triumph, you often only see the good parts of&nbsp;their journey. Hardly anyone takes into account all the effort that they had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;get there. Only them and the people that stuck with them through thick and thin truly know just how challenging it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;to&nbsp;truly fight for a&nbsp;dream. And unfortunately, today, this is&nbsp;even truer when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;people with disabilities because we&nbsp;still live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world where canons of&nbsp;beauty are still fairly rigid.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Luke Bryan Tunes Contestant's Guitar On 'American Idol'</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>
