Just like photography, video and cinema have become a&nbsp;way for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back in&nbsp;time and relive other times, moments, and past stories. It’s the screen that offers&nbsp;us to&nbsp;look back at&nbsp;great actors and leading men that marked an&nbsp;entire era, but it&nbsp;also shows them today with the changes that time and the years have made to&nbsp;their appearance.
