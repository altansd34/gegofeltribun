Turbulence is&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;sudden shifts in&nbsp;the airflow and is&nbsp;nothing to&nbsp;be&nbsp;afraid&nbsp;of. But if&nbsp;that simple knowledge doesn’t help you, try this visualization from a&nbsp;pilot. Put a&nbsp;small piece of&nbsp;napkin inside a&nbsp;pot of&nbsp;jelly. The napkin is&nbsp;the plane, and it’s surrounded by&nbsp;jelly, or&nbsp;sorry, by&nbsp;air pressure. If&nbsp;you tap the jelly, the napkin will not fall anywhere. It&nbsp;just starts slightly moving within the jelly.
Once the plane gets to&nbsp;its cruising altitude, it&nbsp;seems like the engine noise disappears altogether. No&nbsp;worries there&nbsp;— the engine is&nbsp;still working fine!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'Drag Race Sweden' is the Latest Spin-Off in RuPaul's Growing Franchise</h2><time>Aug 22, 2024</time>
