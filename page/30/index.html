Former President Donald Trump is poised to launch his third presidential bid with the bulk of the Republican Party’s electorate behind him, boosted by his handling of the economy and illegal immigration and his pugilistic posture toward the Democrats.&nbsp;
However, the most recent Morning Consult surveys show signs of erosion in that support, and with Florida Gov.
