Growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the 90s meant often indulging in&nbsp;an&nbsp;array of&nbsp;newly released computer games as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;pass time. From puzzle games to&nbsp;pinball and classic card games, there was something for every type of&nbsp;player. The nostalgia of ’90s games is&nbsp;undeniable, with their simplistic yet enduring appeal. While some may argue for outdoor adventures, the fireworks that accompanied victory in&nbsp;those digital realms made it&nbsp;a&nbsp;worthwhile experience.

Correct. One leg is&nbsp;above the other. Both legs are easily seen, don’t merge, and look graceful.

And there are many more famous roles that could’ve been played by&nbsp;other “big” actors but got turned down due to&nbsp;conflicting schedules or&nbsp;personal issues.
