She stated:</p>Did the kids have anything to do with it? Of course they did! All I know is he was upset all the time. Not with me, but with his kids and his ex-wife. They were after him for money, money, money. I don't think he could handle them.<p class=align-left>Robert Kardashian was not Jan's first husband.
