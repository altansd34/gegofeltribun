My&nbsp;name is&nbsp;<a href=#>Maria</a>. I&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;Russia, got married to&nbsp;an&nbsp;Irish man Carl several years ago, and moved to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Ireland data-link=tag>Ireland</a>. Honestly, I&nbsp;haven’t regretted my&nbsp;decision once.</p><p>I&nbsp;am going to&nbsp;tell <strong>Bright Side</strong> readers what it’s like to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;the country of&nbsp;elves, ginger men, magnificent castles, and the shamrock (yes, this is&nbsp;what we&nbsp;call clovers). And at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;small gift&nbsp;— a&nbsp;compilation of&nbsp;useful websites for people who decide to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;cheap vacation in&nbsp;Ireland.</p><p><h2>The head of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Irish family is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman... with a&nbsp;spoon.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e5/00b/e7f44c5d18a2b2901192b1a8e1.jpg><p><a href=#>Gentle and sensitive girls</a> will probably be&nbsp;disappointed by&nbsp;Irish men. They may go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the pub and not return until lunch the next day, they can lose track of&nbsp;time during a&nbsp;sports competition, or&nbsp;forget to&nbsp;invite their wife to&nbsp;a&nbsp;party.</p><p>Strong Irish women have their own friends, plans, and they always have something to&nbsp;do. And also, every one of&nbsp;them has a&nbsp;wooden <a href=#>spoon</a> (it&nbsp;is&nbsp;presented at&nbsp;the wedding). In&nbsp;local families, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;a&nbsp;scepter, the symbol of&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;the mother and the wife. Everyone is&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;the spoon: husbands, children, dogs. Because if&nbsp;you see your mother or&nbsp;wife in&nbsp;the window with the spoon, this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign that means you have to&nbsp;rush home and hope for the best.</p><p><h2>If&nbsp;you get the entire family together, there will be&nbsp;enough people for a&nbsp;small village.</h2></p><p>No&nbsp;matter what we&nbsp;do, we&nbsp;can’t <a href=#>organize</a> a&nbsp;family party with fewer than 30&nbsp;people. And these are the closest ones! If&nbsp;Carl’s parents invite only his brothers and sisters with their wives, husbands, and children, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;already&nbsp;55, and if&nbsp;we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;invite all the twice-removed cousins, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;80&nbsp;people. And if&nbsp;we&nbsp;go&nbsp;just a&nbsp;bit further, it’s 120&nbsp;people!</p><p>While you’re just living your life, you don’t even notice that your family is&nbsp;large enough to&nbsp;populate an&nbsp;entire village. But when the time comes to&nbsp;organize a&nbsp;collective holiday or&nbsp;to&nbsp;buy presents, this is&nbsp;the moment you start to&nbsp;worry.</p><p><h2>Here, you need to&nbsp;start planning a&nbsp;wedding one or&nbsp;even 2&nbsp;years in&nbsp;advance.</h2></p><p>Good <a href=#>locations</a> are very popular and there are huge waiting lists to&nbsp;have weddings there. This year, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;our 7th wedding anniversary, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;start looking for a&nbsp;location right now (and start saving money). In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;organize a&nbsp;wedding celebration in&nbsp;Ireland, you need to&nbsp;spend anywhere from €25,000 to&nbsp;€31,000. An&nbsp;average family could pay their mortgage for about 1.5 years by&nbsp;using this money.</p><p>The most expensive things are obviously the rental for the location and the food. The average bill is&nbsp;about €70-80 per person. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;rare to&nbsp;attend an&nbsp;Irish wedding where there are fewer than 100&nbsp;guests. Live <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> and a&nbsp;DJ cost about €2,000-3,000, the wedding dress for the bride is&nbsp;around €1,500-2,300, the photoshoot and video cost around €4,000-8,000.</p><p><h2>Children and adults are treated by&nbsp;the same doctors.</h2></p><p>Pediatricians exist, too, but only in&nbsp;maternity wards and children’s hospitals. For all other cases, you have your family <a href=#>GP</a>. It&nbsp;doesn’t matter what hurts&nbsp;— your head, your leg, or&nbsp;your butt, the first person you see is&nbsp;the&nbsp;GP, and then he&nbsp;or&nbsp;she directs you to&nbsp;a&nbsp;specialist. A&nbsp;good&nbsp;GP in&nbsp;Ireland (or&nbsp;anywhere for that matter) costs a&nbsp;lot. A&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor in&nbsp;Dublin will cost you €50-80, in&nbsp;other places— €30-60. Children below the age of&nbsp;6&nbsp;get free examinations.</p><p>GPs are very limited in&nbsp;what they can do&nbsp;for a&nbsp;newborn baby. For example, they can’t prescribe antihistamines or&nbsp;treat babies’ eyes. So, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;feeling that a&nbsp;GP only looks after children and diagnoses colds.</p><p><h2>Fathers take part in&nbsp;childbirth and go&nbsp;on&nbsp;paternity leave.</h2></p><p>Men in&nbsp;Ireland are almost required to&nbsp;attend prenatal classes and <a href=#>support their wives</a> during childbirth. Fathers here can easily go&nbsp;on&nbsp;paternity leave, ask for a&nbsp;day off to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;kindergarten theater play, take time to&nbsp;attend their kid’s sports competition, or&nbsp;get sick leave if&nbsp;their child is&nbsp;sick.</p><p>Just 50&nbsp;years ago, men played golf on&nbsp;the weekends. It&nbsp;didn’t matter if&nbsp;their children were ill&nbsp;— they played golf. But today, leaving your family to&nbsp;go&nbsp;find entertainment elsewhere is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wrong.</p><p><h2>Irish mothers-in-law are paid to&nbsp;babysit their grandchildren.</h2></p><p>Very often, the bearded descendants of&nbsp;Vikings turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mama’s boys. One way or&nbsp;another, these mothers make you call them twice a&nbsp;week and visit them as&nbsp;often as&nbsp;possible. They ask you to&nbsp;bring your children to&nbsp;them, they find excuses to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;your place, and some even visit you without warning you in&nbsp;advance. Many families even go&nbsp;on&nbsp;vacation together with their mothers.</p><p>However, mothers-in-law often <a href=#>have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;paid</a> for spending some time with their grandchildren, even if&nbsp;she asks to&nbsp;see them. Yes, it&nbsp;seems that nobody owes anything to&nbsp;anyone in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family, but babysitting is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;work.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;winter, everyone stocks food in&nbsp;advance.</h2></p><p>Once <a href=#>snow</a> appears in&nbsp;the country, the Irish seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;influenced by&nbsp;the genes of&nbsp;their 19th-century ancestors. They probably remember the <a href=#>Great Famine</a> and they are all scared of&nbsp;it&nbsp;happening again. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;other explanation for this craze over buying food. Just the other day, the customers at&nbsp;Dunnes Stores were buying 25(!) loaves of&nbsp;<a href=# title=bread data-link=tag>bread</a> each!</p><p>Our neighbors have already started making a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;foods that are necessary for our neighborhood. We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;hilly terrain and not all cars are able to&nbsp;climb the hills. This is&nbsp;why we&nbsp;have already agreed that, in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;<a href=# title=emergency data-link=tag>emergency</a>, the men will walk to&nbsp;the nearest town on&nbsp;foot.</p><p><h2>You can ask your neighbors for any favor.</h2></p><p><a href=#>Where I&nbsp;live</a>, I&nbsp;have dozens of&nbsp;really great neighbors. Honestly, I&nbsp;know every single one of&nbsp;them, I&nbsp;know some of&nbsp;their birthdays, I&nbsp;know when their vacations are, and&nbsp;I often go&nbsp;over to&nbsp;their places. Sometimes, I&nbsp;let in&nbsp;a&nbsp;plumber or&nbsp;feed a&nbsp;dog. I&nbsp;have so&nbsp;many keys to&nbsp;my&nbsp;neighbors’ places that&nbsp;I look like a&nbsp;concierge. This is&nbsp;how people do&nbsp;it&nbsp;here: they watch over each other’s houses, they help carry in&nbsp;the furniture, they take out trash cans and pick them up&nbsp;if&nbsp;someone is&nbsp;away.</p><p>Also, we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;WhatsApp chat that we&nbsp;use as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bulletin board. You can take some chairs from your neighbors, or&nbsp;get some help if&nbsp;you need&nbsp;it. For example, the guys from the 21st house lent Carl a&nbsp;ladder so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;could get on&nbsp;the roof. The neighbor from house 3&nbsp;will be&nbsp;holding the ladder, but most likely, a&nbsp;whole lot more people will rush over to&nbsp;help.</p><p><h2>Things an&nbsp;average Irish person can’t live without:</h2></p><p>Life in&nbsp;this country is&nbsp;completely <a href=#>impossible</a> without the following things:</p><ul><li><a href=# title=TV data-link=tag>TV</a>&nbsp;— the Irish are always ready to&nbsp;spend some time watching their favorite series or&nbsp;reality show</li><li>Toaster and kettle&nbsp;— both of&nbsp;them are definitely on&nbsp;the kitchen table (toasts are some kind of&nbsp;national food that treats hangovers, and helps you deal with sadness, hunger, and a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;food in&nbsp;the fridge)</li><li>Washing machine&nbsp;— the Irish pay a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;keeping their clothes clean;</li><li>Dryer&nbsp;— clothes will remain wet for weeks without&nbsp;it, and will rot and get covered with mold;</li><li><a href=# title=Dishwasher data-link=tag>Dishwasher</a>&nbsp;— we&nbsp;don’t have hot tap water and it&nbsp;costs more to&nbsp;heat some rather than turn on&nbsp;the dishwasher for one cycle (I&nbsp;haven’t done dishes by&nbsp;hand in&nbsp;about 6&nbsp;years now).</li></ul><p><h2>Few people have heard of&nbsp;healthy food here.</h2></p><p>The food <a href=#>behavior</a> of&nbsp;the Irish doesn’t really comply with the trendy “healthy food” concept. Of&nbsp;course, they don’t lose consciousness when they see an&nbsp;eggplant, they are okay with cauliflower, and even know the difference between bulgur and quinoa. But Carl’s grandmother still thinks that my&nbsp;salad made of&nbsp;vegetables and parsley is&nbsp;some kind of&nbsp;Indian food. Because only someone who really loves cows can eat a&nbsp;basket of&nbsp;grass.</p><p>My&nbsp;people’s freezers are full of&nbsp;frozen foods like: French fries, nuggets, pizza... But the Irish don’t really like freezing meat and prepared foods. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that an&nbsp;average Irish family throws away €700 worth of&nbsp;food. This is&nbsp;because they just can’t use leftovers of&nbsp;food to&nbsp;cook something from them or&nbsp;freeze small portions of&nbsp;food.</p><p><h2>The Irish know everything about potatoes and meat.</h2></p><p>When you are buying potatoes in&nbsp;the supermarket, you should <a href=#>read very carefully</a> what the bag says. Here, there are different kinds of&nbsp;potatoes for different dishes. The potatoes used for mashing are not used for boiled potatoes. The prices start from&nbsp;€1 (for allegedly new potatoes, but they are just small) to&nbsp;€5&nbsp;for 6-10&nbsp;pounds.</p><p>The Irish think that they have the best beef in&nbsp;the world. They grow cows on&nbsp;only grass, which makes the meat very tender. I&nbsp;like steaks that are already sorted in&nbsp;vacuum packs. They are sold for about €9-10 each and are packed in&nbsp;pairs. And <a href=# title=milk data-link=tag>milk</a> is&nbsp;almost free here&nbsp;— about €0.80-1.20 per liter.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;soulmate on&nbsp;the train.</h2></p><p>The passengers that buy tickets online often <a href=#>put their first and last names on&nbsp;the tickets</a>. This date is&nbsp;shown on&nbsp;the screen above the window. The upper line is&nbsp;the window seat, the lower line is&nbsp;the aisle seat.</p><p>You can use this information to&nbsp;find out if&nbsp;someone’s wife is&nbsp;sitting right next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice-looking man. Couples usually sit right in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;each other. Men should know that very few single Irish women even get on&nbsp;a&nbsp;train without a&nbsp;Starbucks coffee. But her name on&nbsp;the cup may be&nbsp;spelled wrong.</p><p><h2>The Irish are famous for their dark humor.</h2></p><p>No&nbsp;matter how bad things are, the locals always <a href=#>find</a> something to&nbsp;laugh&nbsp;at. The jokes are usually about everyday life, politics, or&nbsp;sports. The also like pranks and they are not always nice. My&nbsp;husband competed with his ex-colleague in&nbsp;pranks. Once, Carl took a&nbsp;screenshot of&nbsp;the guy’s desktop screen and used it&nbsp;as&nbsp;screen wallpaper. And he&nbsp;made some of&nbsp;the folders invisible every day. The colleague almost went grey that week.</p><p>When I&nbsp;worked at&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel, a&nbsp;fiancé’s friends put a&nbsp;fake arrest sign on&nbsp;his car for improper parking and it&nbsp;was after the ceremony. You should have seen the guy running around his car trying not to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the party late.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;Ireland, people discuss funerals and memorial services.</h2></p><p><a href=#>The elderly Irish people</a> are crazy about <a href=# title=death data-link=tag>death</a>. “Guess, who died!”, old guys scream when you enter. In&nbsp;other countries, only someone’s pregnancy or&nbsp;divorce get people this interested.</p><p>When the bad news comes, the whole next day, people only talk about the memorial services, how much they cost, and about the will. “How much do&nbsp;the coffins cost these days?” You can often hear people asking, “How much did you pay for digging the grave?” And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not considered rude. What is&nbsp;rude, though, is&nbsp;asking how much you earn.</p><p><h2>Workers are not offered tea.</h2></p><p>Here, any worker you employ is&nbsp;not some poor guy, but a&nbsp;<a href=#>businessman</a> that works a&nbsp;lot. And this guy doesn’t expect to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fed, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;offered <a href=# title=tea data-link=tag>tea</a>, or&nbsp;anything else that is&nbsp;more than you agreed&nbsp;to.</p><p>All the interaction with workers here is&nbsp;more professional than friendly. You can offer tea or&nbsp;coffee when you first meet the guy and he&nbsp;examines how much work has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done. The only exception is&nbsp;when the weather is&nbsp;bad (it’s too cold or&nbsp;too hot). People treat each other in&nbsp;a&nbsp;respectful way, but they don’t cross the line.</p><p><h2>Every sheep has its own number.</h2></p><p>The minister of&nbsp;agriculture issued a&nbsp;manual on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;<a href=#>label</a> sheep properly. Every sheep has its own tag that was given according to&nbsp;the requirements of&nbsp;the National Sheep Identification System. This code contains a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;information, including the name of&nbsp;the owner if&nbsp;the sheep gets lost.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, farmers don’t have enough time to&nbsp;chase every single sheep to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;tag on&nbsp;it. So, they are marked with special paint. It&nbsp;all depends on&nbsp;the imagination of&nbsp;the owner. Some mark their sheep with 2&nbsp;colors, some use just one, some draw patterns. Some do&nbsp;tic-tac-toe, flowers, stripes, the colors of&nbsp;the flag, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;Ireland, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;not spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money in&nbsp;pubs.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;tourist, be&nbsp;<a href=#>ready</a> to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pub. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not acceptable to&nbsp;spend hours drinking one glass of&nbsp;beer. You have to&nbsp;drink in&nbsp;big gulps. A&nbsp;pint should be&nbsp;finished in&nbsp;about 6-8&nbsp;sips, which is&nbsp;about 70-90&nbsp;ml per one sip. The first sip should cover not only the foam but also some of&nbsp;the beer.</p><p>But there are also some life hacks. In&nbsp;small pubs, you should only drink the same beer that most other visitors are drinking. The more alcohol, the fresher the beer. And if&nbsp;I order a&nbsp;Guinness, I&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the foam it&nbsp;has, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;small trace of&nbsp;foam is&nbsp;left on&nbsp;half-empty glasses, if&nbsp;it&nbsp;changes the color, and things like that.</p><p><h2>The locals love sincere songs.</h2></p><p>Music in&nbsp;the Irish culture is&nbsp;a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;<a href=#>speak out</a> and talk about what worries you. Whining and sharing your problems is&nbsp;not appropriate here, but you can use a&nbsp;song for this purpose. The sadder the song&nbsp;is, the better. Even after weddings, few people talk about the bride’s dress, the food, or&nbsp;flowers. Everyone talks about musicians, “The wedding was great, the band and the&nbsp;DJ were awesome, we&nbsp;danced all night long.”</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know what they play at&nbsp;funerals? In&nbsp;Ireland, they can play anything, it&nbsp;just has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;song the person loved. Even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;funny song. Anyone can sing along if&nbsp;they like&nbsp;it. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;respect. Here, when a&nbsp;person plans their funeral, they don’t just put money aside, they also choose the song to&nbsp;be&nbsp;played at&nbsp;the ceremony.</p><p><h2>Once a&nbsp;year, the entire country is&nbsp;painted green.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;happens during the celebration of&nbsp;Saint Patrick’s Day. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;amazing, but the person that introduced Christianity to&nbsp;Ireland was a&nbsp;slave. He&nbsp;was brought to&nbsp;the country to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sold and he&nbsp;spent the first 6&nbsp;years on&nbsp;the island as&nbsp;a&nbsp;shepherd.</p><p>The famous Irish parade <a href=#>takes place</a> on&nbsp;March&nbsp;17, and the preparation starts several days in&nbsp;advance. The buildings are gradually painted green, and <a href=#>shamrocks</a> start appearing everywhere (please, don’t say “clover”). And be&nbsp;attentive: people start drinking as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the pubs open on&nbsp;this day. So, by&nbsp;about 5pm, the entire city is&nbsp;wasted.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;find 10&nbsp;eggs for Easter here.</h2></p><p>The Irish don’t have a&nbsp;tradition of&nbsp;painting eggs on&nbsp;Easter. So, it&nbsp;takes me&nbsp;about a&nbsp;<a href=#>week</a> to&nbsp;find regular white chicken eggs (the local supermarkets mostly have brown eggs). Honestly, it&nbsp;feels like we&nbsp;are looking for pterodactyl eggs. 2&nbsp;years ago, a&nbsp;Polish store made an&nbsp;announcement, “We&nbsp;have white eggs.” But according to&nbsp;the salesperson, they didn’t have any more of&nbsp;them. And later, we&nbsp;found out that they did have some eggs, but they only sold them to&nbsp;the people they knew.</p><p>This year, I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;find 10&nbsp;white eggs at&nbsp;a&nbsp;different store. But they had a&nbsp;sticker, “Past expiry day, eggs for decoration only.”</p><p><h2>The Irish spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money on&nbsp;Christmas.</h2></p><p>On&nbsp;average, <a href=#>about €450</a>&nbsp;is spent on&nbsp;presents, and people start buying food about 10-12 weeks in&nbsp;advance. In&nbsp;the end, a&nbsp;regular family spends about €1,300&nbsp;on <a href=# title=Christmas data-link=tag>Christmas</a>. And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not surprising because in&nbsp;Ireland, people can’t wait until the holidays, and they often eat everything even before the holidays start.</p><p>A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money goes abroad. Doing online shopping before Christmas is&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular thing. Retailers really want the money to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the country so&nbsp;the “Black Friday” sales actually last the entire weekend. Last year, it&nbsp;was 2&nbsp;weeks long! The entire country left their villages and farms and they took their children and went to&nbsp;Dublin to&nbsp;buy stuff. By&nbsp;December, all the stores were completely empty.</p><p><h2>5&nbsp;reasons why you should go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ireland:</h2></p><li>Incredible landscapes. If&nbsp;you <a href=#>drive</a> around the island clockwise, you will see how much the landscape changes. You will start with a&nbsp;never-ending beach, then you’ll drive past cliffs and rocks, and then you’ll return to&nbsp;the incredible beaches of&nbsp;Achill Island.</li><li><a href=# title=History data-link=tag>History</a>. We&nbsp;have castles, abbeys, and megalithic constructions which are older than Egyptian pyramids. And almost all of&nbsp;the islands here have a&nbsp;centuries-old interesting story.</li><li>Pub culture. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;really feel&nbsp;it, you should go&nbsp;to&nbsp;some Irish village.</li><li>The Irish people’s charm. For some mysterious reason, the people from this country are loved all around the world, and in&nbsp;North America, every second person tries to&nbsp;prove that they have Irish roots.</li><li>Cuisine. Juicy steaks, Dublin shrimp, food festivals... Ireland is&nbsp;not only about sausages with bacon. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also about the amazing seafood and great mutton.</li><p><h2>How do&nbsp;you understand when you have crossed the border of&nbsp;Northern Ireland?</h2></p><p>First of&nbsp;all, you will <a href=#>notice</a> that the speed is&nbsp;measured not in&nbsp;miles but in&nbsp;km/h. Then, you will see the many currency exchange in&nbsp;certain places. In&nbsp;every country of&nbsp;Great Britain, you can use pounds to&nbsp;pay, but in&nbsp;Northern Ireland, they may not accept the English money and will need the local currency.</p><p>Also, the British flags. But not always, it&nbsp;depends on&nbsp;where you are. There are towns with hundreds and thousands of&nbsp;British flags. And sometimes, only the green mailboxes and the Irish flags.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Useful websites for tourists</h2></p><p>Since January 2019, in&nbsp;Ireland, the tourist VAT has <a href=#>increased</a> by&nbsp;4.5&nbsp;%. This goes for the prices in&nbsp;the entire industry: restaurants, cafes, hotels. Some owners raise the prices by&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few cents. Some&nbsp;— by&nbsp;€10—12. And don’t forget that Dublin still remains one of&nbsp;the most expensive cities in&nbsp;Europe.</p><p>If&nbsp;you are not a&nbsp;millionaire and you have a&nbsp;very limited budget, you will have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;conscious about how much you spend.
