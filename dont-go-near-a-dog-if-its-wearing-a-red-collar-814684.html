While admiring&nbsp;it, you notice a&nbsp;red collar and remember red is&nbsp;the universal sign for stop. All over the world, you see it&nbsp;on&nbsp;stop signs and stoplights! This cute pup is&nbsp;one you shouldn’t get too close&nbsp;to!</p><p>A&nbsp;red collar on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dog signals that the animal is&nbsp;aggressive and should be&nbsp;given space by&nbsp;humans and other animals! These dogs may be&nbsp;more likely to&nbsp;snap, bite or&nbsp;lunge at&nbsp;any passersby. You may find this hard to&nbsp;believe, given how happy the dog might look when you see it&nbsp;with its handler! You’re right! It&nbsp;probably is&nbsp;delighted because it&nbsp;loves its owner and may also be&nbsp;super protective of&nbsp;them!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dbd/6b4/31284f56dc801cf3cc4d00c86e.png><p>It’s also possible that the dog may be&nbsp;an&nbsp;assistance dog! However, these dogs would wear a&nbsp;vest with ’emotional support’ or ’assistance dog.’ Oh, and please remember three important words, ’Do Not Pet.’ Not all dog owners opt to&nbsp;use color-coded language with their pets. It’s often used more in&nbsp;professional environments. For example, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;dog and their sniffer are required for scent work, they probably have better things to&nbsp;do&nbsp;than getting belly rubs from strangers!</p><p>Their red collar might now serve as&nbsp;your fair warning! It’s a&nbsp;fact that dogs have up&nbsp;to&nbsp;300 million olfactory receptors in&nbsp;their noses. Humans have roughly six million. It&nbsp;means that their sense of&nbsp;smell is&nbsp;about 50&nbsp;times better than ours! The part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dog’s brain devoted to&nbsp;analyzing smells is&nbsp;about 40&nbsp;times greater than ours. Dogs are attracted to&nbsp;new odors.</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;good chance they’d prefer a&nbsp;sniffing session to&nbsp;your offer of&nbsp;a&nbsp;belly rub! It&nbsp;could just annoy them. Why don’t we&nbsp;take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;some other things that can irritate your dog! This first one might hurt your feelings and be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;accept! Have you ever noticed your dog freezing in&nbsp;terror when you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;hug&nbsp;it? Have you ever wondered why? Dogs just don’t like it&nbsp;when you hug them.</p><p>Research has shown you should never constrain your dog, which is&nbsp;exactly what happens when you hug them. If&nbsp;your dog comes looking for&nbsp;it, then OK! But otherwise, a&nbsp;pat on&nbsp;the head will be&nbsp;enough! None of&nbsp;us like returning home to&nbsp;find our beautiful furniture chewed to&nbsp;pieces! Or&nbsp;discovering that our brand-new shoes are ruined. But one thing you shouldn’t do&nbsp;is&nbsp;yell at&nbsp;your dog! Even if&nbsp;they chewed your favorite and the most expensive shoes!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/137/ec5/00f6195b9882d83e9dd5570ad2.png><p>Yelling just confuses a&nbsp;dog. Dogs may simply think you’re barking at&nbsp;them and start wondering what’s happened to&nbsp;its human! I&nbsp;know those puppy eyes are beautiful and hard to&nbsp;look away from, but try not to&nbsp;stare at&nbsp;them too long. Prolonged <a href=# title="eye contact" data-link=tag>eye contact</a> can be&nbsp;another form of&nbsp;aggression to&nbsp;our loyal companions. This even applies to&nbsp;your own dog, who may get spooked by&nbsp;your serious demeanor.</p><p>This is&nbsp;especially true with strange dogs who may be&nbsp;anxious or&nbsp;uneasy with your presence. Try to&nbsp;distract yourself from looking at&nbsp;them by&nbsp;simply focusing on&nbsp;stroking that warm cuddly fur! What else annoys your dog? Whilst your furry friend may be&nbsp;perfectly okay with having extremely oversized nails, one thing they’re often not okay with is&nbsp;their owner trying to&nbsp;clip them.</p><p>Research suggests that dogs hate getting their nails clipped, ears checked and mouth examined! However, these things have to&nbsp;happen as&nbsp;overgrown nails could hurt your dog, and checking their ears could prevent a&nbsp;nasty ear infection! It’s good to&nbsp;get your dog comfortable with you touching their feet and ears before taking them to&nbsp;your local groomer or&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;cut nails yourself!</p><p>Being a&nbsp;responsible dog owner is&nbsp;by&nbsp;making sure they get enough exercise! And dogs always love a&nbsp;walk, right! Well, not always. Let’s be&nbsp;practical about this, you’re at&nbsp;the beach on&nbsp;a&nbsp;sunny day! You walk on&nbsp;the sand barefoot, and suddenly, you feel your feet burning! You quickly struggle back to&nbsp;your towel! See where I’m going with this?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/626/876/ae922e54be9434c265a170999c.png><p>If&nbsp;it’s too hot for your feet, it’s probably too hot for your dog’s paws! And it’s not just burning feet you need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;worried about! The heat itself can harm your dog. Dogs can cool themselves by&nbsp;panting. However, this method is&nbsp;not too effective in&nbsp;hot weather! By&nbsp;moving your dog walking sessions to&nbsp;early morning or&nbsp;late afternoon, you could be&nbsp;doing that puppy of&nbsp;yours a&nbsp;big favor! Variety is&nbsp;the spice of&nbsp;life! And don’t think this doesn’t apply to&nbsp;dogs!</p><p>Especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=games data-link=tag>games</a> you play with them! When we&nbsp;think of&nbsp;games to&nbsp;play with our dog the best most of&nbsp;us can come up&nbsp;with is&nbsp;fetch! We’re not the ones that have to&nbsp;desperately chase after the ball, so&nbsp;this is&nbsp;quite convenient! Be&nbsp;more creative! Try some other games! One of&nbsp;which is&nbsp;tug-of-war which involves equal effort from both dog and human! Dogs love this game and contrary to&nbsp;popular belief it&nbsp;has no&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;aggression. Especially if&nbsp;you alternate between who wins each round!</p><p>This game will also teach your dog a&nbsp;vital skill in&nbsp;impulse control! Games that end early will teach your dog the difference between what’s acceptable and what isn’t! You can also play training games with your dog! Giving your dog a&nbsp;treat when they look at&nbsp;you without being asked to&nbsp;will enable you to&nbsp;have more control over them! Although they’re animals, dogs do&nbsp;have some traits in&nbsp;common with humans! Example? They won’t get on&nbsp;with everybody.</p><p>So&nbsp;don’t try and force a&nbsp;dog into a&nbsp;<a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> with another dog! Some dogs are shy whilst others are social butterflies. Our job as&nbsp;responsible pet owners is&nbsp;to&nbsp;find out how we&nbsp;can make our dogs comfortable. Dogs have different levels of&nbsp;confidence. One dog may be&nbsp;fine with one other dog but become uncomfortable in&nbsp;a&nbsp;group bigger than two! It’s sometimes best to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;small group of&nbsp;dog friends for your dog to&nbsp;play with or&nbsp;just introduce them to&nbsp;new dogs one at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time! But forcing them into uncomfortable situations is&nbsp;a&nbsp;no-go!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d98/d6e/78e2ed512f99bb4057d89c7715.png><p>One thing we’re all sometimes reluctant towards is&nbsp;change! One thing that a&nbsp;dog loves to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;make their owner happy! So&nbsp;if&nbsp;your dog’s not listening to&nbsp;you there’s a&nbsp;good chance it’s because your rules aren’t consistent enough! Consistency is&nbsp;something that dogs love! It&nbsp;allows them to&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;behave in&nbsp;different situations! Telling them to ’lay down’ after previously using the word ’sit’ can cause major confusion!</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, you should probably make a&nbsp;daily schedule for your dog! This will prevent your dog expecting a&nbsp;game of&nbsp;tug-of-war when you’re trying to&nbsp;get ready for work! And one thing you need to&nbsp;put into this schedule is&nbsp;some time outside of&nbsp;the house! This will teach your dog how to&nbsp;behave in&nbsp;new environments! You can’t just expect your dog to&nbsp;enter one of&nbsp;the many dog friendly cafes that now exist and know how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good girl or&nbsp;boy! Take baby steps, if&nbsp;your dog becomes excited you’re moving too fast!</p><p>Oh, and don’t forget those yummy treats to&nbsp;reward your pooch for good behavior! With all of&nbsp;the attention our dogs pay to&nbsp;ourselves, it’s only fair that we&nbsp;should do&nbsp;the very same with them. Not paying attention to&nbsp;your dog’s body language isn’t good! Just because they don’t speak a&nbsp;language doesn’t mean you can’t tell what’s going on&nbsp;inside their head! Research shows that dogs speak with their bodies!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/117/b7d/0a7e565f5899ebadda36787586.png><p>Although some behavior, like leaning in&nbsp;for more attention are pretty universal, dogs have very different ways of&nbsp;showing their anxiety, from freezing in&nbsp;place to&nbsp;an&nbsp;odd tail wag. A&nbsp;dog’s eyes, tail, ears and posture are key to&nbsp;understanding how your pet is&nbsp;feeling! Paying close attention to&nbsp;how your dog responds to&nbsp;different social settings will also allow you to&nbsp;prevent any uncomfortable situations moving forward!</p><p>The most obvious thing your dog doesn’t like? Being ignored. Neither dogs nor humans have the energy to&nbsp;play all day. But time does need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;carved out of&nbsp;your schedule for someone on&nbsp;one bonding!</p><p>Food and shelter isn’t the only thing these creatures need! This is&nbsp;especially true when adding a&nbsp;new dog to&nbsp;your home! Dogs may also feel left out. Please make sure the older dog doesn’t feel unloved!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLGwutNmnqhlnpqus3nAZpuon12es26106xksJ2Rp7avs4yaZKudlGKwsLjLmqlmcGFpg3mAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./derek-hough-announces-rescheduled-dates-for-his-symphony-of-dance-tour.html><span>←</span><span>Derek Hough Announces Rescheduled Dates for His Symphony of Dance Tour</span></a>
