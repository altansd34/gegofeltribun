They pointed specifically to his choice of words for Michael Williams and Olivia Soli, who were both eliminated Monday night.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-fans-criticize-host-ryan-seacrest>American Idol Fans Criticize Host Ryan Seacrest</h2><p>During Monday’s show, Seacrest was tasked with letting members of the Top 20 know if they had been voted into the Top 12 by America’s votes, or were in danger of elimination. He had some interesting ways of breaking the news.</p><p>First, he told Michael Williams, “Last night you sang ‘Lose You to Love Me.’ After the vote, we might lose you tonight.” A Reddit user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>commented</a> that this phrasing was “so nasty.” Other users <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>remarked</a> that Seacrest was “not softening any blows” and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>“being such a d*ck tonight.”</a></p><p>Later, he told Olivia Soli, “Last night you sang a Celine Dion classic. Katy told you to keep playing the power card. After the vote, America wants to see more power.” The audience cheered, and Olivia looked relieved. However, Seacrest clarified, “Not in the Top 12.”</p><p>It was definitely a confusing moment reminiscent of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the judges’ fakeouts</a> while sharing good news during the Showstoppers round. But it was especially uncomfortable here, because Olivia was ultimately eliminated. As one Reddit user commented, “Did Ryan just do a reverse fakeout on Olivia?”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RYAN SEACREST BIDS FAREWELL TO ‘LIVE WITH KELLY AND RYAN’ STAFF WITH HEARTFELT DINNER</a></strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>FUCK how Ryan Seacrest told Oliva Soli that she wasn’t in the top 12.

Other Reddit commenters had positive things to say about how he kept the show moving. After all, Seacrest has been American Idol‘s host for over 20 years now.</p><p>“Ryan keeping this episode moving at breakneck pace without it feeling rushed. That’s why he deserves his paycheck,” wrote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>one user</a>. Another user chimed in to agree, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>writing</a>, “Hardest working man in television.”</p><p>What do you think of Seacrest’s hosting style? Should he have been more clear about whether or not contestants were moving on?
