<a href=../../../as-jodie-foster-turns-60-here-are-the-5-reasons-why-she-embraces-aging-with-such-elegance-809973.html></a>
As&nbsp;she turns&nbsp;60, actress and director Jodie Foster embodies the idea of&nbsp;aging with grace. Having started her career at&nbsp;just&nbsp;3, the star is&nbsp;no&nbsp;stranger to&nbsp;fame, yet her own lifestyle and philosophy have always been so&nbsp;far from the glitz and glam of&nbsp;Hollywood. And with each of&nbsp;her performances and public appearances, Jodie sets a&nbsp;perfect example of&nbsp;what it&nbsp;means to&nbsp;be&nbsp;confident, true to&nbsp;yourself, and comfortable in&nbsp;your own skin as&nbsp;you age.
She keeps her lifestyle down to&nbsp;earth.
Despite having started to&nbsp;act from a&nbsp;tender age and then becoming one of&nbsp;the top actresses of&nbsp;her era, Foster has never allowed fame to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;her head.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Britons support ID cards, CCTV monitoring and fingerprint database</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>

Cheddar dominates Britons' cheese tastes more than any other cheese in any Northern European countryEurope remains the global home of fine cheeses. America's monterey jack has increased in popularity recently, but it has none of the heritage of European cheeses, and while India's paneer is a global export, it's mainly a cheese for cooking. Various cream cheeses are also rooted elsewhere, but in many non-European cuisines cheese simply doesn't feature highly in meals.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>General election 2024: Tories at lowest favourability score with one week to election</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>
