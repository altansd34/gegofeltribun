There are more than a&nbsp;million words in&nbsp;the English language but, somehow, we&nbsp;suddenly lose all our vocabulary when we&nbsp;get startled. It&nbsp;seems like all the energy gets focused on&nbsp;feeling instead of&nbsp;thinking. Some experience it&nbsp;more often than others but, in&nbsp;any case, everyone can relate.
Bright Side found 15&nbsp;photos that are not only attention-grabbing, but also vocabulary-stealing.
1. “Shaved in&nbsp;half”
2. “My&nbsp;sister works at&nbsp;a&nbsp;driving school. She sent me&nbsp;this picture from her desk today.”
3. “A&nbsp;hen taking care of&nbsp;frightened kittens during a&nbsp;storm”</article><article class=post-entry><h2>16 Unusual Things That Made Us Go, I Dont Know Why but I Definitely Need That</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>

Today, you can buy almost anything: shoes in&nbsp;any design you like, plates with cats on&nbsp;them&nbsp;— anything. But sometimes, we&nbsp;come across such cool things that they change our entire understanding of&nbsp;creativity.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side feel really great when we&nbsp;see things made by&nbsp;people who really follow their inspiration. The bottom of&nbsp;this bottle looks like a&nbsp;rose.

When we&nbsp;look at&nbsp;a&nbsp;picture we&nbsp;can’t understand at&nbsp;first glance, our brain doesn’t try to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;us what is&nbsp;happening in&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;prefers to&nbsp;“add” familiar patterns and create a&nbsp;beautiful illusion. This explains the effect of&nbsp;cognitive dissonance that the photographs in&nbsp;our compilation produce.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side prefer to&nbsp;not let our own brains fool&nbsp;us, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;figure out what was going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;each of&nbsp;these 25&nbsp;photos. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, you just need to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;them twice, or&nbsp;you could just read the captions.
