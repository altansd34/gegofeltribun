Just one episode of&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV series is&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;hours of&nbsp;work and dozens of&nbsp;takes. For example, the famous Battle of&nbsp;Winterfell in&nbsp;the 8th season of&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones took 55&nbsp;nights to&nbsp;shoot. When the scale is&nbsp;this big, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not surprising that the production team makes mistakes from time to&nbsp;time.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side watched every season of&nbsp;our favorite show again and discovered the bloopers that the creators themselves missed.

We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side love the color yellow and want to&nbsp;understand why cartoonists seem to&nbsp;fancy it&nbsp;so&nbsp;much.

Branded items can be&nbsp;quite expensive, and there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason for this. Manufacturers are responsible for the item’s highest quality, using natural leather and on-trend colors, and making sure that the item will serve you for a&nbsp;long time. The price of&nbsp;a&nbsp;genuine item includes not just the cost of&nbsp;the materials that it’s made from, and human labor, but also the history of&nbsp;the fashion house, which always makes the item more valuable. But sometimes it’s really hard to&nbsp;distinguish an&nbsp;original from a&nbsp;replica, which will fall into pieces after a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>10+ Tricks That Help Celebrities Wear Uncomfortable Shoes for Hours and Still Look Stunning</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>
