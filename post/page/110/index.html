Sometimes, life can be&nbsp;harder for celebrities because their fans and haters are prepared to&nbsp;pick apart their appearances for days on&nbsp;end. But the stars from our compilation clearly don’t pay attention to&nbsp;comments like these, and they’ve turned their alleged “flaws” into unique features that we&nbsp;can’t imagine them without. Photoshop can work wonders, so&nbsp;let’s fantasize about what our favorite celebrities would look like without their distinguishing traits.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side were very impressed with the results and are anxiously awaiting your opinions in&nbsp;the comments.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Your Home Would Look Like on 8 Different Planets</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>

As&nbsp;we&nbsp;all know, living basically anywhere besides Earth in&nbsp;our solar system would be&nbsp;near-impossible. However, that doesn’t stop some researchers from imagining what life on&nbsp;other planets would be&nbsp;like if&nbsp;and when we&nbsp;colonize space. So, let’s forget about that for a&nbsp;moment and assume that we&nbsp;have the capabilities to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;and that no&nbsp;danger is&nbsp;real for&nbsp;us.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side assumed all necessary technology is&nbsp;in&nbsp;place to&nbsp;achieve our wildest fantasies and imagined what our homes on&nbsp;other planets would look like.
