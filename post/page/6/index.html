Amanda Jones has dedicated the past 20&nbsp;years to&nbsp;an&nbsp;incredible photography project which aims to&nbsp;show just how fleeting the lives of&nbsp;our beloved pets are. We’ve all had that odd feeling that a&nbsp;lively puppy seems to&nbsp;turn into a&nbsp;fully-grown, wise old dog over night. Some of&nbsp;them barely change at&nbsp;all, others begin to&nbsp;show some signs of&nbsp;age. Dogs in&nbsp;particular age faster than&nbsp;us, of&nbsp;course, and perhaps that’s why the following photos are a&nbsp;bit sad as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;very sweet. But we&nbsp;can always take comfort in&nbsp;the knowledge that, however old they are, the joy we&nbsp;get from that bond with our best friend never diminishes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Money Does Adan Canto Make?
