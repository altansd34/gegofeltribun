Kissing kids on&nbsp;the lips often stirs up&nbsp;controversy and discussions. Many parents, including famous figures like David Beckham, continue to&nbsp;share pictures of&nbsp;themselves giving their children lip kisses despite the criticism they face. Some argue that this practice is&nbsp;a&nbsp;harmless way to&nbsp;express love and affection for their kids, underlining the strong parent-child bond. Despite criticism, David Beckham believes kissing your children on&nbsp;the lips is&nbsp;an&nbsp;innocent way to&nbsp;show how much you love them.
It’s his way of&nbsp;expressing love.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Derek Hough Announces Rescheduled Dates for His Symphony of Dance Tour</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>

The 28 year-old had decided to conduct her own, personal, 18-month experiment, wherein she let all her body hair grow without intervening to remove it – no waxing, shaving, tweezing or threading allowed – to see if she could get used to it, and be at one with it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hajia 4Reall buys N143k red roses, N1.6m Dior bag for herself on Val's Day, Ghanaians React to Video</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>
