Every woman in&nbsp;Japan plans her day in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that suits her. But in&nbsp;general, everyone’s schedule is&nbsp;more or&nbsp;less the same, especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;working mother or&nbsp;housewife. It’s curious to&nbsp;learn how different the way of&nbsp;life for women in&nbsp;Japanese society is&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;what Western women are used&nbsp;to.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side have studied the blogs of&nbsp;local women and made an&nbsp;approximate daily schedule that most Japanese women adhere&nbsp;to.

A poignant example surfaced recently on Reddit, where a husband poured out his anguish upon uncovering years of deceit.
He wrote:

Tonsilitis probably saved my life. I was one of those little kids who got it at least once a year and it didn’t stop when I grew up. By the time I reached my twenties it was so painful and so frequent my doctor said I’d have to have my tonsils removed. So I did. It was the first and only operation I ever had and, of course, it worked. No tonsils equals no tonsilitis.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Justine Bateman, Former Family Ties Star, Opens Up About Choosing to Age Naturally</h2><time>Aug 4, 2024</time>
