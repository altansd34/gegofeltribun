Given the unimaginable horror of what is happening in the Middle East it might seem a little eccentric to devote this week’s debate to what some might regard as no more than a question of semantics. But I believe it’s much more than that. I refer, as you have probably guessed, to the BBC’s refusal to describe Hamas as terrorists. You are (I assume!) a licence fee payer and your view on this highly controversial decision matters.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Katie Cassidy bio: age, height, partner, plastic surgery, net worth</h2><time>Aug 16, 2024</time>

Love can suddenly surprise&nbsp;us when we&nbsp;least expect&nbsp;it. One of&nbsp;our readers was on&nbsp;cloud nine after her boyfriend proposed. However, everything came crashing back down to&nbsp;earth the very next day. Now she’s caught in&nbsp;this mix of&nbsp;love, hurt, and confusion, wondering how in&nbsp;the world she ended up&nbsp;on&nbsp;this emotional rollercoaster.
Our reader dropped&nbsp;us a&nbsp;message.
Nothing has changed. The fact that he was laughing with his ex is neither here nor there!
Thanks for getting in&nbsp;touch!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>My Husband Made Me Paranoid About My Body Odor, But the Reason Why He Did It Left Me Fuming</h2><time>Aug 16, 2024</time>

A&nbsp;35-year-old woman wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;desperate letter. She shared her struggles to&nbsp;accept that her husband turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mean. He&nbsp;constantly made comments about her body odor, which seriously impacted her mental health. But she was absolutely furious when she found out the real reason behind his behavior. After hearing the details of&nbsp;his scheme, we&nbsp;completely sympathize with her.
The woman’s marriage to&nbsp;her husband has always been wonderful.
