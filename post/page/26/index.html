The female body is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;wonders. For example, during pregnancy, the uterus stretches from the size of&nbsp;an&nbsp;orange to&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;watermelon&nbsp;— not to&nbsp;mention the fact that women are more flexible than men and more likely to&nbsp;survive traumatic injuries. And celebrity women prove this to&nbsp;be&nbsp;true as&nbsp;well. Despite their tremendous amount of&nbsp;work and travels, these famous ladies managed to&nbsp;give birth after&nbsp;40, and they’re rocking the mom life.
Here at&nbsp;Bright Side, we’re inspired by&nbsp;women who break stereotypes, and we&nbsp;can’t help but share these pics of&nbsp;celebrities who became proud mamas after the age of&nbsp;40.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>15+ Photos of Nature That Totally Look Like Something Else</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>
