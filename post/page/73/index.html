Researchers suggest that you gaze more at&nbsp;logos placed on&nbsp;the left side of&nbsp;items than on&nbsp;the right, and this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fact that you might not have realized before. This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the main reasons why the logos on&nbsp;items are almost always on&nbsp;the left, but it’s not the only reason.
Bright Side learned about the basic reasons why logos are placed on&nbsp;the left side, and we&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;share these reasons with you.
They’re placed on&nbsp;the side we&nbsp;naturally gaze&nbsp;at.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'American Idol' Season 5 Alum Mandisa's Cause of Death Revealed</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>
