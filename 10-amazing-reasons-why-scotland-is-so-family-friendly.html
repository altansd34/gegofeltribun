<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Scotland offers so many family-friendly ways to make living and working here so special</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>4. Opportunities for all children</h2><p>Scotland's Year of Young People 2018 celebrates our young people, acknowledges&nbsp;their achievements, values their contribution to communities, and creates&nbsp;new opportunities for them to shine locally, nationally and globally. Similarly, The Programme for Government’s&nbsp;Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan, published in March 2018, sets out a range of concrete and ambitious actions to meet targets that will reduce child poverty to the lowest level in Scotland’s history.</p><h2>5. World-class education</h2><p>You can’t put a price on a good education. Literally. That’s why all children living in Scotland are <a href=#>eligible for free education</a>. Our schools operate a Curriculum for Excellence which provides knowledge, skills and attributes for learning and life to all nursery, primary and secondary schooling between the ages of 3-18.</p><p>Fact: we’re home to more world-class universities per capita than almost anywhere else in the world! Scotland has led the world in its commitment to excellence in education for centuries. Did you know we were the world’s first country to provide universal education to boys and girls, way back in the 17th century?</p><h2>6. A working week that won’t work you into the ground</h2><p>The great part of raising a family in Scotland is that we have an amazing work/life balance, and more employers than ever are offering flexible working opportunities. This means that you don't need to walk a tightrope between the workplace and home - giving you more time to enjoy the things that really matter!</p><p>Generally, <a href=#>the average work week in Scotland</a> is between 37 and 40 hours per week, with time allotted for lunch breaks.</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scotland.org/images/uploads/general/snowfactor-48-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>7. A clean bill of health without the bill</h2><p>Thinking about moving here but concerned about medical costs? It shouldn’t bump up your blood pressure. Unlike many other countries, Scotland offers <a href=#>free healthcare under the National Health Services</a> (NHS). This includes free hospital care and treatment from your local doctor (GP), including free prescriptions for medication you may need.</p><h2>8. A small country that’s big on career fairness</h2><p>Looking after a family and a having a career can be tough, which is why Scotland offers <a href=#>maternity/paternity leave for those starting a family</a>. Whether you or your partner are pregnant, you're adopting or starting a family in any other way, there are many flexible options for you to settle into parenthood, including up to 52 weeks leave which can be shared between both parents.</p><p>To help women return to work, there are now several schemes, including The Women Returners Programme, run by Equate Scotland, which promotes the advancement of women in science, engineering, technology and the built environment.&nbsp;</p><h2>9. There’s so much for families to do in Scotland</h2><p>From tottering toddlers to tenacious teenagers, Scotland is not short on <a href=#>events and activities for the family</a>. We’re home to over 200 festivals every year (many aimed at kids and big kids at heart!), including the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world’s largest arts festival. Day in, day out, there's&nbsp;always something going on near you.</p><p>And the great part? You can slot them in the evenings and weekends. During the summer, Scotland benefits from an average of 17 hours of daylight&nbsp;and, even after a long day's&nbsp;work, there’s plenty of time to take the kids out&nbsp;or to enjoy a few drinks with friends. Enjoy&nbsp;a show or two if the babysitter’s booked!</p><p>So, wherever you're from in the world and wherever you choose to lay your hat in Scotland, remember this: Scotland is family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjqKlrKiZp661tc6nZmpoXZa6osbIp55mqpWWwLC60mauobFdqLCwwMuapZ1lmah6tLuMn5imoZyueqe%2ByJ6lnaSp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1496533-quavo-fuels-rumours-saweetie-allegedly-slept-cardi-bs-husband-offset-a-song-messy.html><span>←</span><span>Quavo Fuels Rumours That Saweetie Allegedly Slept With Cardi Bs Husband Offset in a New Song M</span></a>
