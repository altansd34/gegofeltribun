Kodi is a person with autism, but his magnificent talent transcends beyond this disability. As he joins AGT All-Stars this year, no bars are holding him back from snatching another Golden Buzzer, much more another winning title.</strong></p><p>Raised in South Carolina, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kodi</a> was born with optic nerve hypoplasia, making him legally blind. Soon after this diagnosis, his doctors found out about his autism, then Addison’s disease. Yet, while these conditions would seemingly block his potential, Kodi is a hero of himself, discovering his tonality at the early stage of his life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kodi-lee-marked-a-historic-win-in-america-s-got-talent>Kodi Lee Marked a Historic Win in America’s Got Talent</h2><p>Before his audition performance, Kodi entered the stage with his mom Tina Lee who briefly explained about his disabilities. Lee was branded to be a “musical prodigious savant,” and it did not take long for him to prove that. He sang Leon Russell’s “A Song For You” while playing the piano, immediately leaving AGT fans emotional and fascinated. Such amazing moment was further intensified by judge Gabrielle Union who pressed her Golden Buzzer for him.</p><p>Kodi didn’t disappoint until the last second of his Finale act. At the end of the competition, he marked history as the first ever contestant with autism to reach the Finals and win the show. Impressively, he was also the only solo singing act to make it to the Top 5, beating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Detroit Youth Choir</a>, Ryan Niemiller, V.Unbeatable and Voices of Service.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Has Kodi Been Up To After AGT?</h2><p>For those who may not know, Kodi is a musician with an audio photographic memory. This extraordinary ability, which only approximately 25 people in the world today possess, allows him to recall music that he hears with just one listen. Hence, it’s only right to say that things were just getting started after he won <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> season 14.</p><p>Kodi continued to explore his passion for music, headlining his own show in Paris Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada. In addition, he treats fans with free performances via his Instagram and TikTok accounts.</p><p>Despite his busy schedule, Kodi remains consistent with his advocacy to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">raise awareness</a> for the community of people with autism. At present, he performs locally in different venues including local restaurants, wineries, and music events all around town.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kodi Learned a New Skill Amid the Pandemic</h2><p>The musical genius returned to the stage and sang Harry Styles’ “Sign of the Times” on the&nbsp;AGT: The Champions Finale. This invitation has been warmly welcomed by Kodi, although he didn’t participate in the competition at the time.</p><p>His musical style ranges from rock, R&B, pop, and jazz. He’s also pretty much a master when it comes to classics, perfectly playing Bach, Chopin, and Mozart among others.</p><p>However, Kodi perhaps knows no limits. Over the years, he’s also enhanced his tap-dancing skills — one that he incorporates with his vocal abilities. Fans definitely appreciate his journey to self-improvement.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Recently Released a Music Video</h2><p>Among the many milestones of the now 26-year-old singer is the recently released music video of his original song, <a href=#>“Miracle.</a>” This emotional project features himself playing the piano while showing home videos of his childhood. Kodi is evidently excited and grateful for this creative opportunity.</p><p>Immediately after this achievement, Kodi revealed that he’d be competing in AGT All-Stars. Upon hearing the announcement, several people have expressed their support for him.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_KatyPerry_OrlandoBloom_Michael-KovacGetty-Images-for-Lifetime-220x153.jpg alt="Did Katy Perry Secretly Marry Orlando Bloom?
