The pro dancer revealed an unsettling encounter between fans and her infant son Rome that left her deeply concerned.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-followed-jenna-johnson-s-nanny-son-in-a-hotel>Fans Followed Jenna Johnson’s Nanny, Son in a Hotel</h2><p>In her Instagram Story, Johnson first recapped what an amazing show they had that night during the tour stop. However, her tone shifted when she described what transpired afterward at their hotel.</p><p>“We had a little incident where [Rome] and my nanny were followed onto the elevator of the hotel that we’re staying at,” she said.</p><p>Johnson said her son and his nanny were further “followed onto the floor that our room was on.” She explained that the fans involved were giggling, taking photos, and making the nanny feel extremely uncomfortable. As Rome’s mother, she said the whole thing felt dangerous and scary.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro proceeded to directly ask fans to please respect her family’s privacy and boundaries moving forward. While she loves the enthusiasm surrounding them, she insists Rome is “just a baby” and his safety is paramount.</p><p>“Please just respect our privacy. For me, as his mom, that’s really dangerous and I really don’t appreciate that,” Johnson said.</p><p>She reiterated her excitement about the tour but emphasized the need for “some boundaries” when it comes to her infant son. Johnson is currently on tour with fellow DWTS pro and husband <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Val Chmerkovskiy</a> and baby Rome.</p><p>The concerning incident sparked debate among DWTS fans regarding Johnson’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> presence. Some wondered if her very public documentation of Rome’s life contributed to blurred boundaries with fans.</p><p>Despite this, most agree stalking a baby is never justified, regardless of how much access Johnson provides online. Johson’s plea on Instagram about the incident that crossed boundaries and made her feel unsafe as a mother, certainly reached the fans.</p><p>“Stalking is unacceptable EVEN IF Jenna posts her son online. There’s no excuse,” one fan wrote on Reddit.</p><p>While the origins may be debated, Johnson made it clear this hotel run-in rattled her as a mother. Her plea showed that while she loves engaging with supporters, her son’s safety comes first. Hopefully, her important reminder helps reset those boundaries moving forward.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_SelenaGomez_Kevin-WinterGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Selena Gomez Gets Candid About Body Image with Past and Present Snaps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6lp5ldn7yputKopWaonJqupb%2BMsKCtoF2brq%2B%2FjJ%2Bmq2Wgp7a3rcKyZJqepJq%2Fbr%2FCmqmyZZmjsKqwxKerZqGeq7ytwsinnmahnpuur8CMrKanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-she-pregnant-again-blake-livelys-recent-appearance-has-everyone-wondering-819767.html><span>←</span><span>Is She Pregnant Again, Blake Livelys Recent Appearance Has Everyone Wondering</span></a>
