When she asked him with a&nbsp;playful challenge, “Daddy, take me&nbsp;to&nbsp;the Barbie movie premiere, but wear something <a href=# title=pink data-link=tag>pink</a>, or&nbsp;will you be&nbsp;embarrassed?” he&nbsp;wholeheartedly embraced the idea, knowing it&nbsp;would delight her. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview,</a> Eleazar humbly shared, “For the sake of&nbsp;pleasing my&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, I&nbsp;would do&nbsp;anything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4db/a93/e2e3245bea98123db7a20e9bb5.jpg><p>Eleazar’s wife, Alejandra Ortiz, played a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;making his special gesture possible. With Katherine’s tutus as&nbsp;their only option, Alejandra happily <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>assisted</a> in&nbsp;crafting a&nbsp;tutu for Eleazar. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;excitedly explained, “We&nbsp;had already purchased the movie premiere tickets online a&nbsp;month before. The idea of&nbsp;the tutu was spontaneous.” Alejandra’s support and creativity made it&nbsp;all come together, ensuring Eleazar could fully embrace the Barbie persona and make their daughter’s dream a&nbsp;reality.</p><p><h2>They had a&nbsp;great time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc1/ad1/28f991593fa0e25ef487b45a64.jpg><p>The family had so&nbsp;much fun together at&nbsp;the Barbie movie premiere. Though Eleazar was initially hesitant about wearing the tutu, his daughter’s smile and her holding his hand with pride gave him the confidence to&nbsp;not care about what others might think. As&nbsp;they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>arrived</a> at&nbsp;the cinema, all eyes were on&nbsp;him&nbsp;— people asking for photos, and some even pointing and admiring his bravery.</p><p>Despite the attention, Eleazar found it&nbsp;all immensely enjoyable. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “From the moment&nbsp;I stepped out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;truck in&nbsp;the cinema parking lot, people started congratulating&nbsp;me, which gave me&nbsp;even more courage because, honestly, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;little embarrassed.”</p><p><h2>The family never thought that they would go&nbsp;viral.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d6/af0/8089ae538cba7b63b8938a68ba.jpg><p>The family never anticipated their simple outing to&nbsp;the cinema would turn into a&nbsp;viral sensation. Eleazar <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clarified</a>, “I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;clear that&nbsp;I wore the tutu to&nbsp;please my&nbsp;daughter. I&nbsp;am truly surprised by&nbsp;how far the photos have spread, as&nbsp;I never did it&nbsp;with the intention of&nbsp;seeking attention on&nbsp;social media; it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;family thing that got out of&nbsp;hand.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e56/f6e/7f641d53bdb172c3aa76a1b5c3.jpg><p>Despite the unexpected attention, he&nbsp;remained steadfast in&nbsp;his love for his daughter. Responding to&nbsp;criticism for wearing a&nbsp;tutu, Eleazar courageously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “Thank you to&nbsp;everyone for your comments; there are more positive ones. Believe&nbsp;me, wearing a&nbsp;tutu and dressing in&nbsp;pink doesn’t make you any less of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man. I&nbsp;have the courage to&nbsp;fulfill my&nbsp;daughter’s wishes, and I’d go&nbsp;to&nbsp;great lengths for her happiness.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/534/745/dfc79d5b04ab30e5cf6d275947.jpg><p>Another dad that went above and beyond for his son is&nbsp;the inspiring tale of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single gay dad who fearlessly <a href=#>embraced</a> parenthood by&nbsp;adopting an&nbsp;ill child.
