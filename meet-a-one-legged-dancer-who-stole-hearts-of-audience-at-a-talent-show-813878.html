<span>Tandra Barner</span></p><h1>Meet the Dancer Who Lost His Leg to Childhood Cancer but Didnt Let It Stop Him From Pursuing His</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Musa Motha, a&nbsp;27-year-old amputee <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dancer</a> from <a href=# title="South Africa" data-link=tag>South Africa</a>, caused a&nbsp;wave of&nbsp;awe and inspiration when he&nbsp;took the stage on&nbsp;<i>Britain’s Got Talent</i>. Musa, who lost a&nbsp;leg to&nbsp;childhood cancer, turned his situation into a&nbsp;burning passion for dance, impressing the judges and audience with his stunning performances.</p><p><h2>Motha used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;soccer player before he&nbsp;received his diagnosis.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc2/7b0/6980c4562d89b4a630a397482b.jpg><p>Musa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Motha</a> grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;Sebokeng, an&nbsp;underdeveloped area of&nbsp;Johannesburg, South Africa. Although his surroundings were far from perfect, there was a&nbsp;makeshift soccer field across the street from his home. For Motha, this was “paradise,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Unfortunately, the boy was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed</a> with cancer at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age, which resulted in&nbsp;the amputation of&nbsp;his left leg, dashing his hopes of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;professional soccer player. But instead of&nbsp;letting his new reality defeat him, the young Musa chose to&nbsp;confront it&nbsp;head-on. Rather than focusing on&nbsp;what he&nbsp;had lost, he&nbsp;found comfort in&nbsp;the rhythm and melodies of&nbsp;<a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a>, using them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;strength and motivation.</p><p>“After my&nbsp;amputation, I&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with music. My&nbsp;friends were dancing at&nbsp;that time and&nbsp;I asked them to&nbsp;teach me&nbsp;how to&nbsp;dance,” he&nbsp;told the judges. “I&nbsp;used my&nbsp;left crutch as&nbsp;my&nbsp;left leg, and that is&nbsp;how it&nbsp;started.”</p><p><h2>His performance stole the hearts of&nbsp;both the judges and those who watched.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/516/ecd/123a625ffc8fb9f6eca29bdf28.jpg><p>Recently, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Motha</a> has captured the hearts of&nbsp;Britain with his dancing on&nbsp;the <i>Britain’s Got Talent</i> stage. Judge Simon Cowell remarked that he&nbsp;had never seen the audience react so&nbsp;strongly before. Every single person, including the judges, rose to&nbsp;their feet for a&nbsp;prolonged standing ovation.</p><p>Although the rules stated that each judge could only use their golden buzzer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>once</a>, an&nbsp;extraordinary situation called for an&nbsp;exceptional solution. The judges gave in&nbsp;to&nbsp;the audience’s persistent demands and all four pressed their golden buzzers simultaneously. This marked the first time in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;<i>Britain’s Got Talent</i> that a&nbsp;group golden buzzer was awarded.</p><p><h2>Motha wants others to&nbsp;show their talents too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82f/088/7ace2d550181630e1b63871b79.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the interview, Motha <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;dream of&nbsp;not only being known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dancer but also creating a&nbsp;space for others with disabilities to&nbsp;explore their passions, whether it&nbsp;be&nbsp;soccer or&nbsp;singing. He&nbsp;believes that by&nbsp;increasing representation, access and inclusion will follow, allowing individuals with disabilities to&nbsp;showcase their talents.</p><p>“Instead of&nbsp;telling a&nbsp;sob story, I&nbsp;find that the most beautiful stories are after (the amputation),” Motha <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. He&nbsp;encourages others with disabilities to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything they set their minds&nbsp;to, saying, “There’s a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;things that you can overcome that actually define how strong you are.”</p><p>Talent shows are amazing places to&nbsp;discover ordinary people with extraordinary talents. For example, another 11-year-old <a href=#>girl</a> who performed on&nbsp;<i>America’s Got Talent</i> could sing opera in&nbsp;8&nbsp;different languages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqmsdNmmGannpp6rbHGoJydZZSWu6Sx0WauoaddqMGwuMRmn56ZoqnAbrvFZpiunJmau6SxjJqrZpldqa6tsc2tZKygn6x6eX2ScW5xZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lionel-richie-recalls-sentimental-recording-of-we-are-the-world-it-was-our-innocence.html><span>←</span><span>Lionel Richie Recalls Sentimental Recording of We Are The World: It Was Our Innocence</span></a>
