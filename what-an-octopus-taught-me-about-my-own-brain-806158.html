And although we&nbsp;spend many hours learning about the world around&nbsp;us at&nbsp;school, there are always new surprising facts to&nbsp;be&nbsp;discovered that might not have been covered by&nbsp;the curriculum. But learning is&nbsp;a&nbsp;life-long journey, and it’s never too late to&nbsp;broaden our knowledge.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>came across some astonishing facts that can surprise even the most well-informed people.</p><p><h2>1. Octopuses can like or&nbsp;dislike humans.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f82/bad/3f5417526fa0c303026eab8fa0.jpg><p>Because of&nbsp;their complex intelligence, there are many tasks that are considered “human” that octopuses can also perform. Octopuses can develop <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>memories</strong></a><strong> of&nbsp;humans and even make “friends” and “enemies.”</strong> They also recall the nicknames people give them and will approach a&nbsp;person if&nbsp;they call them by&nbsp;these names. But if&nbsp;an&nbsp;octopus dislikes you, they will squirt water in&nbsp;your direction.</p><p><h2>2. They also plan ahead and use tools.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe1/7b8/b00d71553f9aa0df516ab51aff.jpg><p>Another reason why octopuses are considered so&nbsp;smart is&nbsp;their <strong>use of&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>tools</strong></a><strong>.</strong> For example, they have been observed carrying coconut shells and using them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;house, or&nbsp;protective shelter. Although carrying something as&nbsp;big as&nbsp;a&nbsp;coconut shell can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;big feat for most octopus species, this just shows that <strong>they are thinking ahead and planning for the future. </strong>The makeshift shelter helps to&nbsp;protect them from underwater predators.</p><p><h2>3. Solving puzzles and escaping from rooms are no-brainers for an&nbsp;octopus.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a1/1ed/b39d38556da01899d36ac8bcb8.jpg><p>While octopuses can’t solve a&nbsp;Rubik’s cube (yet), <strong>they enjoy </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>playing</strong></a> with this object. On&nbsp;the other hand, there are several tasks that require good problem-solving skills that the species excels&nbsp;at. An&nbsp;octopus will <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>throw objects</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;targeted manner if&nbsp;it&nbsp;feels threatened by&nbsp;its mates. They can also <strong>escape from closed </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>jars</strong></a><strong> and navigate through </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>mazes</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><h2>4. They make and store memories in&nbsp;an&nbsp;almost human way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a28/515/385dbe57af8641552d49077d7b.jpg><p>Scientists have suspected that humans form long-term memories by&nbsp;a&nbsp;process called LTP (long-term potentiation). This process includes an&nbsp;“engraving of&nbsp;memory traces” in&nbsp;the brain and contributes to&nbsp;storing information for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p>Once again, <strong>both we&nbsp;and the octopus species use the same method to&nbsp;form and store memories.</strong> According to&nbsp;researchers, this suggests that LTP is&nbsp;indeed a&nbsp;critical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>process</a> that we&nbsp;must study if&nbsp;we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;know more about learning and remembering information.</p><p><h2>5. Peanut butter can be&nbsp;turned into diamonds.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afb/e2e/4b7c5f54739507b74765b52410.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Peanut butter</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;carbon-rich material, so&nbsp;scientists have been using it&nbsp;to&nbsp;simulate the conditions under which diamonds are made. First, they need to&nbsp;extract the oxygen from carbon dioxide and then subject the peanut butter-derived carbon to&nbsp;very high temperatures and pressure. The result is&nbsp;<strong>a&nbsp;diamond-like crystal made entirely of&nbsp;<a href=# title="peanut butter" data-link=tag>peanut butter</a></strong>.</p><p><h2>6. Goldfish are virtuosos in&nbsp;disguise.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e09/36e/f620c459d997d4bd7a3315a67e.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;study, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>goldfish</a> can recognize classical music so&nbsp;well that <strong>they can tell the difference between music</strong> composed by&nbsp;Bach and Stravinsky. And although goldfish might really be&nbsp;virtuosos in&nbsp;disguise, they first needed to&nbsp;get familiar with the pieces, which took them several tries.</p><p><h2>7. The odds of&nbsp;a&nbsp;coin flip are not 50-50.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed8/6cb/9e2c365a02a84a9f883a3979f6.jpg><p>While it&nbsp;is&nbsp;generally believed that the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>probability</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;coin toss is&nbsp;50/50, in&nbsp;fact, <strong>one of&nbsp;the sides of&nbsp;a&nbsp;coin always has a&nbsp;bit more of&nbsp;an&nbsp;advantage</strong>. And this depends on&nbsp;the side that is&nbsp;facing up&nbsp;before the coin is&nbsp;flipped. So&nbsp;the odds of&nbsp;a&nbsp;coin flip are actually 51/49, but still pretty close to&nbsp;an&nbsp;equally likely event.</p><p><h2>8. Trees can communicate with other trees.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91b/608/0c2a445edbacb91e3334161441.jpg><p>Trees use a&nbsp;complex <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>underground network</a> for <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> purposes. Thanks to&nbsp;the fungi living in&nbsp;the soil and their connected roots, <strong>trees can send each other and even other plants signals about droughts and insect attacks</strong>. Furthermore, some trees even share their resources with other trees using this underground network.</p><p><h2>9. Koalas hold onto tree trunks to&nbsp;cool themselves down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/597/e6c/cb2e935f8ebf9ccf8190cd188d.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you ever wondered why koalas hug and press their bodies into trees, it’s not (only) to&nbsp;support their body weight and prevent them from falling off. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Researchers</a> who have observed koalas’ behavior found that, during hotter weather, koalas hold onto the tree trunks even closer. <strong>They also like to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;lower parts of&nbsp;the tree</strong>, using it&nbsp;to&nbsp;cool their bodies and regulate their temperature.</p><p><h2>10. Bananas are actually berries.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dbd/f55/a022b1579da607462fd5ce59b5.jpg><p>While they look nothing like strawberries or&nbsp;blueberries, bananas belong to&nbsp;the botanical category of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>berries</a>. <strong>This is&nbsp;determined by&nbsp;the part of&nbsp;the plant that develops the fruit.</strong> And because bananas develop from a&nbsp;single ovary and have a&nbsp;soft outer layer and fleshy middle part, they can be&nbsp;called berries. Even more surprisingly, blueberries and strawberries cannot botanically be&nbsp;considered berries.</p><p><h2>11. Cows can communicate their feelings.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/432/fed/c9b2775284a0bc3141070d0bf7.jpg><p>A&nbsp;recent study about cows looked into how they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>communicate</a> using their moos. It&nbsp;has been found that <strong>cows can have “individual voices.”</strong> Through their moos, they can express emotions such as&nbsp;excitement and distress. The researchers have remarked that cows usually have very distinct voices, which can easily be&nbsp;told apart from the rest of&nbsp;the herd.</p><p>Have you ever heard of&nbsp;these facts before?
