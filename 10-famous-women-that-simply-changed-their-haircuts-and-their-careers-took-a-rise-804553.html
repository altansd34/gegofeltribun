She first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dyed</a> her hair red when she started working on&nbsp;the teenage comedy <i>Superbad</i>. Producer of&nbsp;the film Judd Apatow insisted that she dye her hair. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good decision. Before the film, Stone was not a&nbsp;famous actress and her new hair color called attention to&nbsp;her. In&nbsp;this new look, she became a&nbsp;true star and got an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oscar</a>.</p><p><h2>Olivia Wilde</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e9/211/e807e3528393e090fcfebb222e.jpg><p>Olivia Wilde admits that changing her appearance really affected the trajectory of&nbsp;her career. For a&nbsp;few years, she acted with her natural hair color. But when she started auditioning with brown hair, everything changed.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “When I&nbsp;was really blonde, it&nbsp;was always like, “The really pretty girl.” At&nbsp;that point in&nbsp;my&nbsp;career, it&nbsp;was all lame pilots&nbsp;— those were the types of&nbsp;roles&nbsp;I was going for. And then when&nbsp;I went brunette, the roles went to&nbsp;more, “She’s a&nbsp;waitress with a&nbsp;heart of&nbsp;gold and a&nbsp;tough life,” or&nbsp;“She’s a&nbsp;doctor.” And I&nbsp;always wondered&nbsp;— would&nbsp;I have been offered those roles had&nbsp;I still been blonde? I&nbsp;don’t think&nbsp;so.</p><p><h2>Gwen Stefani</h2></p><p>According to&nbsp;the famous singer herself, her decision to&nbsp;change her hair color really impacted her life. She is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;natural blonde, she used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brunette</a> at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;her career. She shares, “I&nbsp;remember my&nbsp;boyfriend and&nbsp;I had just broken&nbsp;up, and&nbsp;I was like ’I don’t care how much it&nbsp;costs, I’m getting my&nbsp;hair bleached!’ That’s really when everything changed.”</p><p><h2>Rita Hayworth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b2/688/a0961d57a6be8a9e0ae2e04ea6.jpg><p>Rita Hayworth is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> actresses from the 1940s. But her potential wasn’t discovered right away. Her first roles weren’t very noticeable.</p><p>She had really dark hair and it&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recommended</a> that she change her image. It&nbsp;was the only way to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;the image of&nbsp;an&nbsp;exotic Mediterranean girl. She dyed her hair dark red and adjusted her hairline to&nbsp;make her forehead higher. This look <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>allowed</a> her to&nbsp;become really successful.</p><p><h2>Leighton Meester</h2></p><p>The creator of&nbsp;Gossip Girl <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that Leighton Meester came to&nbsp;the audition with light hair. But a&nbsp;blonde girl had already been cast&nbsp;— <a href=# title="Blake Lively" data-link=tag>Blake Lively</a>, so&nbsp;Leighton was asked to&nbsp;dye her hair brown. She agreed and it&nbsp;helped her get one of&nbsp;the biggest female roles in&nbsp;the series and become famous.</p><p><h2>Amy Adams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fab/514/756abb58418da35b3454c1fccd.jpg><p>Amy Adams <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that she dyed her light hair red and her chances of&nbsp;getting new roles increased dramatically. She says that back when she was a&nbsp;blonde, people only saw her characters as&nbsp;“silly girls” but when she became red, her characters turned into fun and unusual women. “It&nbsp;was really fascinating to&nbsp;see just one element of&nbsp;yourself change people’s perception and that became a&nbsp;very powerful tool for me&nbsp;even in&nbsp;my&nbsp;acting.”</p><p><h2>Debbie Harry</h2></p><p>Debbie Harry is&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer and songwriter, and she was the singer in&nbsp;the band Blondie. Before the band, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;secretary, a&nbsp;waitress, and a&nbsp;dancer. After that, she got into music, changed her hair color, and created her own band. Thanks to&nbsp;her beauty, talent, and unusual look, she quickly became a&nbsp;punk icon.</p><p><h2>Cynthia Nixon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/88e/5db/5ec4ff56d2aa8246e414284141.jpg><p>Natural blonde, Cynthia Nixon, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dyed</a> her hair red to&nbsp;get the part in&nbsp;<i>Sex and the City</i>. The producer didn’t like the fact that there were so&nbsp;many blondes in&nbsp;the project, so&nbsp;Nixon was asked to&nbsp;change her image. The actress agreed and got the job on&nbsp;the project that made her a&nbsp;star.</p><p><h2>Sofía Vergara</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/654/3cc/a985c75a6d86598432b4022e88.jpg><p>The star of&nbsp;<i>Modern Family</i> decided to&nbsp;change her hair color to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the spotlight. Sofía Vergara <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “I’m a&nbsp;natural blonde. But when&nbsp;I started acting, I&nbsp;would go&nbsp;to&nbsp;auditions and they didn’t know where to&nbsp;put me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I was voluptuous and had the accent&nbsp;— but&nbsp;I had blonde hair. It&nbsp;was ignorance: They thought every Latin person looked like Salma Hayek. The moment&nbsp;I dyed my&nbsp;hair dark, it&nbsp;was, ’Oh, she’s the hot Latin girl.’ I&nbsp;loved&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>Reese Witherspoon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc0/ec5/95bf6c5e0180732cd8dc050ea1.jpg><p>The iconic blonde, Reese Witherspoon, actually has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dark brown hair</a>.
