This genetic disorder causes tumors to&nbsp;form on&nbsp;nerve tissue, which can result in&nbsp;a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;symptoms from mild to&nbsp;severe. For Adam, this meant a&nbsp;future filled with surgeries and medical challenges. Neil, on&nbsp;the other hand, would face his own set of&nbsp;hurdles, albeit different from his brother’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/529/358/45d3e353fe9b45a4eeae5bca3a.jpg><p>Marilyn <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> the moment she knew something was wrong. Adam had bumped his forehead, and the lump didn’t go&nbsp;down. This led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;medical tests and the discovery of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fibroma in&nbsp;his neck, blocking his windpipe. It&nbsp;was the beginning of&nbsp;numerous operations and hospital stays.</p><p><h2>They received the same diagnosis, yet they are affected differently.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f3/f37/0f1a0852a29b0d6f354b566a68.jpg><p>At secondary school, Adam <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>faced</a> relentless teasing due to his facial deformation. He was often called names like "Elephant Man" and "freak." Despite this, Adam remained resilient, using his humor and confidence to navigate these tough times. His ability to rise above the trolls is a testament to his strength and character.</p><p>Adam has undergone 33&nbsp;operations to&nbsp;remove tumors and is&nbsp;currently blind in&nbsp;one eye, with the other eye’s sight diminishing. He&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offered</a> a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;medical trial in&nbsp;the United States, which aims to&nbsp;shrink tumors with medication. Although the trial presents risks, including potential retinal detachment, it&nbsp;also offers a&nbsp;ray of&nbsp;hope.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dff/856/a45ca654e0a497451965dc2bb0.jpg><p>While Neil’s condition did not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>manifest</a> in&nbsp;the same visible way as&nbsp;Adam’s, he&nbsp;faced his own battles. His short-term memory was severely affected, and he&nbsp;was diagnosed with epilepsy a&nbsp;year later. This has significantly impacted his daily life, requiring him to&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;a&nbsp;precise routine to&nbsp;manage his memory loss.</p><p><h2>Though they walk different paths now, they are still each other’s supporters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb1/66a/5f313b5a9aa087a8eb330ec0a0.jpg><p>Despite their individual challenges, Adam and Neil have always supported each other. They understand each other’s struggles better than anyone else and face their battles together. Their bond is&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful testament to&nbsp;the strength of&nbsp;family and the human spirit.</p><p>Adam has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>used</a> his experience to&nbsp;advocate for others with facial deformation. He&nbsp;has starred alongside Scarlett Johansson in&nbsp;the film <i>Under The Skin </i>and worked on&nbsp;the dating show <i>The Undateables</i>. His public presence is&nbsp;not about fame, but about spreading the message that it’s okay not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;okay.</p><p>His latest movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Different Man</i></a> tells a&nbsp;story about an&nbsp;aspiring actor who undergoes a&nbsp;radical medical procedure that transform his appearance. However, the transformation turns into another nightmare as&nbsp;he&nbsp;becomes obsessed to&nbsp;reclaim what was lost.</p><p>Paul Karason, the world-renowned "blue man" famously known as Papa Smurf, started life as a fair-skinned, freckled redhead. However, the 2000s saw a dramatic transformation as he turned into an internet sensation and a frequent TV guest, candidly discussing his unusual condition.
