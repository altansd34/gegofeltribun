And so&nbsp;far, nobody has found out what treasures and mysteries they hide. Here are 4&nbsp;doors that keep their secrets all too well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/070/83a/7358bc5f3a84c210eb96fc225b.png><p>The Taj Mahal. First&nbsp;up, we’ve got the Taj Mahal in&nbsp;India, one of&nbsp;the most romantic places in&nbsp;the world. Shah Jahan commissioned it&nbsp;in&nbsp;1631 and dedicated it&nbsp;to&nbsp;his third wife who he&nbsp;loved like crazy. They were married for 19&nbsp;years and had a&nbsp;whopping 14&nbsp;kids together! But, unfortunately, she passed away while giving birth to&nbsp;their last baby.</p><p>Shah Jahan was heartbroken and decided to&nbsp;build an&nbsp;epic tomb to&nbsp;remember her&nbsp;by. The construction took a&nbsp;whopping 20&nbsp;years to&nbsp;finish. The building has quite an&nbsp;interesting layout. The design is&nbsp;super unusual with these four massive 130-ft tall minarets that stand on&nbsp;the corners of&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge platform. They’re not just there for looks.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;the 17th century, architects were having some serious issues with buildings collapsing under their own weight. So, the chief architect of&nbsp;the Taj Mahal made sure to&nbsp;place those minarets as&nbsp;far away from the tomb as&nbsp;possible. And he&nbsp;even tilted them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way so&nbsp;that if&nbsp;they did fall, they wouldn’t wreck the rest of&nbsp;the Taj Mahal. Talk about planning ahead!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/37d/901/ef92b252b697ae5f4edb67c4e6.png><p>The Taj Mahal is&nbsp;hiding some crazy secrets. There are sealed rooms all over the place that nobody is&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;enter. And if&nbsp;you check out photos of&nbsp;the building from the riverside, you can spot two basements. But guess what? They’re sealed up&nbsp;too! Nobody knows what’s inside or&nbsp;why they’ve been locked up&nbsp;since the time of&nbsp;Shah Jahan.</p><p>Apparently, there’s a&nbsp;good reason why those rooms are off-limits. Some researchers think that they were built using marble, which turns into a&nbsp;different substance called calcium carbonate if&nbsp;it’s exposed to&nbsp;carbon dioxide. And when that happens, little bits of&nbsp;marble start chipping off like crazy. To&nbsp;make matters worse, there’s no&nbsp;air flowing into these rooms. That means that if&nbsp;too much CO2 builds up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the basement, the 4&nbsp;minarets could collapse!</p><p>But wait, there’s more! Some people think that the body of&nbsp;Shah Jahan’s wife can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;these sealed-up rooms, in&nbsp;pristine condition. Why not? Who knows what the mysterious rooms might keep.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d04/aa5/0956955d419a68783ff0b7ed15.png><p>The Great Sphinx of&nbsp;Giza. The Great Sphinx of&nbsp;Giza is&nbsp;shrouded in&nbsp;mystery. It’s not just the largest monolith statue in&nbsp;the world, but it’s also a&nbsp;hybrid creature with a&nbsp;woman’s head and a&nbsp;lion’s body that originates from Egyptian and Greek mythology. It’s also very ancient: it’s estimated to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around 4,500 years old.</p><p>The construction of&nbsp;this marvel took about 3&nbsp;years and required 100&nbsp;workers, who were not slaves and were treated with delicacies like sheep and goat meat. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also thought that it&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;much more massive than it&nbsp;is&nbsp;now. Archeologists found huge stone blocks and abandoned toolkits near the site. However, the real secrets of&nbsp;the Sphinx lie underground, near its paws.</p><p>A&nbsp;group of&nbsp;scientists used a&nbsp;seismograph to&nbsp;detect two hidden chambers beneath the Sphinx’s paws. Some people think that these rooms might be&nbsp;the legendary “Hall of&nbsp;Records,” which holds ancient scrolls revealing the secrets of&nbsp;the universe. I&nbsp;mean, that’s way cooler than any library I’ve ever been&nbsp;to. Rumor has it&nbsp;that the Egyptians even had info on&nbsp;Atlantis stashed down there, which is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;super old version of&nbsp;a&nbsp;conspiracy theory.</p><p>Unfortunately, we&nbsp;can’t go&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;adventure to&nbsp;check it&nbsp;out just yet. The chambers presumably have 2&nbsp;entrances, but both remain sealed. The researchers haven’t yet received the green light to&nbsp;check out their theory. Let’s hope they won’t keep&nbsp;us in&nbsp;suspense forever!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/38c/56b/4343465468a22bd8a8f0dfe372.png><p>Sree Padmana-bha-swamy Temple. This temple is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;the beautiful state of&nbsp;Kerala in&nbsp;India. This temple is&nbsp;famous for more than just its breathtaking beauty. Underneath the temple, there are 6&nbsp;vaults, creatively named A, B, C, D, E, and F.&nbsp;The enormous iron doors to&nbsp;these chambers add to&nbsp;the mystery of&nbsp;what’s behind them. A&nbsp;few years back, the authorities decided to&nbsp;open these vaults to&nbsp;the world, but it&nbsp;wasn’t an&nbsp;easy task.</p><p>You can’t just open the doors and enter the vaults: it&nbsp;required a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;work. It&nbsp;took them a&nbsp;while, but finally, in&nbsp;2011, they opened five of&nbsp;the six chambers. And guess what they found? Tons of&nbsp;treasure! Bags of&nbsp;gold, precious gemstones, and priceless diamond jewelry. The estimated worth of&nbsp;everything found in&nbsp;the vaults is&nbsp;a&nbsp;whopping $1&nbsp;trillion! It’s like the temple was the real-life inspiration for Aladdin’s Cave of&nbsp;Wonders.</p><p>But wait, I&nbsp;said five of&nbsp;the six. What happened to&nbsp;the last one? Vault B&nbsp;has remained closed, but not for lack of&nbsp;trying. They simply didn’t manage to&nbsp;open&nbsp;it. There is&nbsp;even a&nbsp;belief that it’s fatally cursed! Legend says that only a&nbsp;saint or&nbsp;sage can break the curse by&nbsp;chanting a&nbsp;specific mantra. But no&nbsp;one has been able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this yet, presumably because we&nbsp;don’t have saints or&nbsp;sages at&nbsp;our disposal.</p><p>There is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;rumor, that in&nbsp;the 30s some temple invaders tried to&nbsp;enter Vault B&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;some good old looting. But they never reached their target. Apparently, terrible snakes materialized out of&nbsp;nowhere and chased the gang away. But of&nbsp;course, this is&nbsp;just an&nbsp;urban legend, and there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;proof of&nbsp;that. However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;said that the Auditor General dealing with the temple claimed that Vault B&nbsp;had been opened at&nbsp;least seven times since 1990, and nothing bad happened to&nbsp;anyone who entered. Who knows? Maybe we&nbsp;should send Indiana Jones to&nbsp;check it&nbsp;out!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/531/614/8fafa954d2b1aa7a3350042846.png><p>The First Emperor’s Tomb. Deep under a&nbsp;hill, completely undisturbed and surrounded by&nbsp;dangerous traps, lies an&nbsp;ancient 2000-year-old tomb. It&nbsp;belongs to&nbsp;Qin Shi Huang, aka the First Emperor of&nbsp;<a href=# title=China data-link=tag>China</a>. He&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;the Qin state and became king when he&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;boy.</p><p>But when he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;and gained full power, he&nbsp;united the warring states ancient China was divided into by&nbsp;conquering them. After that he&nbsp;created the Qin Dynasty. When he&nbsp;died in&nbsp;210&nbsp;BCE, they buried him deep underground in&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive tomb. And when&nbsp;I say massive, I&nbsp;mean MASSIVE!</p><p>Back in&nbsp;1974, some farmers in&nbsp;Xi’an, China, stumbled upon something strange while digging a&nbsp;well&nbsp;— a&nbsp;huge terracotta soldier. This discovery led to&nbsp;an&nbsp;extensive archaeological dig that has continued for over 40&nbsp;years, revealing a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;clay soldiers. The unique thing about these soldiers is&nbsp;that each one has its own unique features, from hairstyles to&nbsp;facial expressions. It’s believed that there could be&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;8,000 of&nbsp;these soldiers, but only 2,000 have been found so&nbsp;far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/daf/456/f4a8ae523bbb0e86dc820b96a0.png><p>Interestingly, the central tomb, which is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the resting place of&nbsp;the emperor, is&nbsp;still untouched. In&nbsp;ancient records, there are references to&nbsp;a&nbsp;vast underground city that the emperor built, complete with scenic towers, palaces, and whatnot. Sima Qian, a&nbsp;Han dynasty historian, wrote that the tomb was adorned with treasures and had space for hundreds of&nbsp;officials. But the lack of&nbsp;technology to&nbsp;properly examine the site is&nbsp;what’s holding things&nbsp;up.</p><p>Qin Shi Huang was surrounded by&nbsp;liquid mercury in&nbsp;his tomb, with two of&nbsp;the streams representing the major rivers of&nbsp;China: Yellow River and Yangtze. The ancient Chinese believed that mercury could provide immortality, but it&nbsp;could have also caused the emperor’s death since he&nbsp;regularly took mercury pills to&nbsp;prolong his life.</p><p>The dangerous levels of&nbsp;mercury contamination in&nbsp;the soil near the tomb are the main reason why scientists are reluctant to&nbsp;explore&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;very dangerous both for people and for the environment! Now, if&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;choose which door to&nbsp;open, I’d probably go&nbsp;for the one that doesn’t lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tomb surrounded by&nbsp;poisonous mercury. Call me&nbsp;crazy, but I’d like to&nbsp;avoid any potential health hazards!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYytn55lo5qws7HTZpuop6JivKd506GcZp%2Bimq61edKpn6KmqGK2tHnNnq2eql2kvaa6xJ1kcWlka4Byew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-so-many-cartoon-characters-are-yellow-801121.html><span>←</span><span>Why So Many Cartoon Characters Are Yellow</span></a>
