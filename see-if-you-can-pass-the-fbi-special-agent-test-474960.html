Who is the mother?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a05/573/ad0a1a51208dc2f5d093bde040.jpg><p>This is the first test. Look at the picture.</p><p>There are two ladies in a room who are sitting opposite each other while a little boy plays on the floor. Study the image well.</p><p><strong>Question.</strong> Who do you think is the real mother of the child?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08b/a95/eb12ab5d8faed69ca34037514e.jpg><p><strong>Answer.</strong></p><p>The mother of the child is the lady on the left. She is sitting so that her legs are directed towards the child.</p><ul><li>This position reflects the natural desire of a mother to protect her child.</li><li>The posture of the woman on the left is protective, slightly bent forward.</li><li>It is natural for small children to face their mother when playing or doing some sort of activity, if she is around.</li></ul><p><h2>2. Two pills</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c6/a9d/cad15d5bb4bd993f21a6dc27f4.jpg><p>A serial killer kidnapped people and made them take one of two pills, one was harmless, and the other was poisonous. Whichever pill a victim took, the serial killer took the other one. Each time, the victims died and the serial killer survived.</p><p><strong>Question</strong>. How did the killer always get the harmless pill?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b7/322/bf34b8533bb9f3547b3f2a058d.jpg><p><strong>Answer.</strong></p><p>Both pills were harmless. The poison was in the glass of water the victims drank.</p><p><h2>3. Beverages</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a8/59a/d83bd35cc3a088a58e5a1792e0.jpg><p>A man and a woman went to a restaurant for dinner. While they were waiting for the main dish, she ordered 5 drinks with <a href=# title=ice data-link=tag>ice</a> because it was very hot. The woman drank 4 of them all at once, while the man only drank one. After a while the man became ill and died. The doctors said that all the drinks were poisoned.</p><p><strong>Question.</strong></p><p>Why was the woman still alive when the man died? Read again carefully.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7e/575/be16b65122b790eb2bb54bf1e8.jpg><p><strong>Answer.</strong></p><p>The poison was in the ice. Since the woman had her drinks quickly, the ice didn't have time to melt. The man drank slowly and the poison melted into his drink.</p><p><h2>4. Cassette</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/089/db7/cbcc485162b7f5bbfaafa20053.jpg><p><strong>Question.</strong></p><p>Imagine a scene. A man was found dead, he has a pistol in his hand and a cassette recorder next to him. The detective pressed the "Play" button and listened the message, it said "I am tired of this life and decided to stop my pain and suffering" and then a shot follows. Somehow the detective doesn't believe that it was a suicide.</p><p>Why does the detective think that it was a murder?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/20b/0f9/df34af5dffb912d4b00b662103.jpg><p><strong>Answer.</strong></p><p>If the man killed himself, how could he rewind the cassette to the beginning?</p><p><h2>5. Christmas mistery</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd6/1cb/d0f8185bc0812b8874fa791969.jpg><p>An detective was on duty during the Christmas holidays and on the morning of December 25th he went on a call. He rang the doorbell, and a minute later a sleepy house owner opened it. The detective said "Your neighbor says that yesterday, on Christmas Eve, he came to your place for a party and while he was here, you broke into his house and stole some valuable items."</p><p>The owner replied: "That's not true. Our family celebrated Christmas Eve at our friends place. We barely had time to decorate our <a href=# title="Christmas tree" data-link=tag>Christmas tree</a>."</p><p>The detective said: "No worries. It's quite obvious for me that your neighbor is a liar."</p><p><strong>Question.</strong> How did the detective know?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbe/7ac/528cdf5983ab26a01cd8a837a7.jpg><p><strong>Answer.</strong></p><p>The Christmas tree lights are unplugged and actually missing one bulb, they wouldn't work without it. It was clear for the detective that the owner was telling the truth. He had decorated the tree in such a hurry that he didn't even check to see whether the lights were working or not.</p><p>Have you nailed it?
