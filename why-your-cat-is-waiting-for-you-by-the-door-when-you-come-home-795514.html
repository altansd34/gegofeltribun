It&nbsp;all began with the agricultural boom in&nbsp;Central China, when people started seeing cats as&nbsp;useful animals&nbsp;— since they were great at&nbsp;controlling the damage done by&nbsp;rodents.</p><p>Many years have passed and now there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;cat <a href=# title=lovers data-link=tag>lovers</a> around, and even though these pets are considered cold-hearted, they do&nbsp;have their own ways of&nbsp;showing affection.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>decided to&nbsp;find out the reasons behind cats being able to&nbsp;know when you are arriving home. And we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;share them with you.</p><p><h2>They can hear you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/897/921/86fcfd5c67b0a1a6abcc70bc43.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;wonder that your cat knows exactly when you are about to&nbsp;enter your home, they have great hearing, can detect a&nbsp;broad range of&nbsp;frequencies, and hear higher-pitched sounds than humans and, actually, most dogs.</p><p>So, when you park in&nbsp;your garage or&nbsp;take the elevator, they know, because they hear you. Over time, they associate that specific sound with your arrival and are ready to&nbsp;say&nbsp;hi. And that takes&nbsp;us to&nbsp;the next reason behind why your cat is&nbsp;by&nbsp;the door waiting for you when you get home.</p><p><h2>They know your routine.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0f/8a8/a6b96f51e5948d078a72bd4c78.jpg><p>Besides their hearing, cats have another trick they use to&nbsp;figure out exactly when you are coming home. They have a&nbsp;good sense of&nbsp;time, which means cats can figure out when in&nbsp;the day you are coming home.</p><p>Routine is&nbsp;something that makes sense to&nbsp;them, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;follow along, and enables cats to&nbsp;know the time of&nbsp;your arrival, especially if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;consistent schedule, which they can learn and get used&nbsp;to.</p><p>Let’s imagine you come home every day around 7&nbsp;p.m., your pet gets familiar with it&nbsp;and expects you to&nbsp;arrive by&nbsp;this time. This doesn’t just work for your arrival, they can follow a&nbsp;routine in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;different aspects, especially if&nbsp;it&nbsp;involves their dinner time.</p><p><h2>They want your love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a7c/14a/423dae5a3986038c3a91babed6.jpg><p>Usually when we&nbsp;get home to&nbsp;our pets, we&nbsp;give them attention or&nbsp;<a href=# title=treats data-link=tag>treats</a>, especially if&nbsp;we&nbsp;have spent long hours away from them. It’s totally normal to&nbsp;give this extra portion of&nbsp;love and care when you arrive home, and they love&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>They want food.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb7/67c/8b820b5e229a760d308fff5bda.jpg><p>Besides getting super-excited to&nbsp;spend some time with you, cats can have something else on&nbsp;their minds, like, food. They have been a&nbsp;good boy or&nbsp;girl all day long and can’t wait to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated with some delicious thing that only you can give them, therefore, they wait for you, so&nbsp;you don’t forget about them.</p><p>Does your cat do&nbsp;this or&nbsp;other cute things? Let&nbsp;us know in&nbsp;the comments and don’t forget to&nbsp;post a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;your furry baby!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyypq6qXZiutXnIrGSwmZmptq%2BzjJ%2Bmq2WppMJurthmq6GdXZm8sL6MsJ%2Bepl2uvLZ5wqiknmWYpLqmeZZybG5pZGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1553876-who-james-haven-angelina-jolies-brother.html><span>←</span><span>Who is James Haven?
