During the episode, Xochitl Gomez earned the first perfect score of the season for her Tango. At the end of the night, we had to say goodbye to Barry Williams and Peta Murgatroyd.</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We absolutely wanna dance with Xochitl Gomez & <a href=#>@iamvalc</a> 🤩 <a href=#>#DWTS</a> <a href=#>#WhitneyHoustonNight</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0Y3wb4J0gm</a></p>— Dancing with the Stars #DWTS (@officialdwts) <a href=#>November 15, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-xochitl-gomez-earns-first-perfect-score-of-dwts-season-32>Xochitl Gomez Earns First Perfect Score of DWTS Season 32</h2><p>For Whitney Houston Night, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Xochitl and her partner Val Chmerkovskiy</a> danced the Tango to “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me).” Judge Carrie Ann Inaba called it a “flawless” performance, while Derek Hough told them, “That is how you do a Tango.”</p><p>Guest judge Billy Porter described the routine as “magical,” and Bruno Tonioli said it was “dancing at its best.” The panel’s scores reflected their glowing reviews of the performance, as they gave Xochitl and Val 10s across the board — the first perfect score of the season.</p><p>Later in the episode, Ariana Madix and her partner Pasha Pashkov came close to a perfect score themselves. They performed a Paso Doble to “Queen of the Night.” Inaba was critical of what she described as “awkward” moments, but she still gave the dance a 9.</p><p>The other judges were more positive, with Hough calling the dance “fantastic.” They gave Ariana and Pasha 10s, leaving them with a total score of 39 out of 40 and putting them in second place on the night’s leaderboard.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ARIANA MADIX CALLS ‘DWTS’ THE ‘MOST REWARDING EXPERIENCE’</a></strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@MrBarryWilliams</a> & <a href=#>@petamurgatroyd</a> left us all wanting more after this <a href=#>#WhitneyHoustonNight</a> Rumba! 🤩 <a href=#>#DWTS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iNYRi1CCsE</a></p>— Dancing with the Stars #DWTS (@officialdwts) <a href=#>November 15, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-barry-williams-peta-murgatroyd-were-eliminated>Barry Williams, Peta Murgatroyd Were Eliminated</h3><p>At the end of the night, one couple had to go home after the judges’ scores were combined with votes from the viewers at home. Barry Williams and Peta Murgatroyd were named as the eliminated couple.</p><p>Barry and Peta performed a Rumba to “Didn’t We Almost Have It All.” They earned a combined score of 32 out of 40, which was still higher than Harry Jowsey and Rylee Arnold, who received a score of 28 for their Viennese Waltz to “I Have Nothing.”</p><p>Barry really shined during the dance-off portion of the episode, where he went up against Jason Mraz and Daniella Karagach. Both couples danced a Salsa to “It’s Not Right But It’s Okay.” Barry showed off some spicy moves, even ripping his shirt open at one point. It was enough for the judges to choose him as the dance-off winner.</p><p>What do you think about the results of tonight’s DWTS episode? Should Barry and Peta have gone home?
