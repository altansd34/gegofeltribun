The former X Factor guest judge recently shared how she feels about being the genius behind the world’s most successful boy band.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nicole Scherzinger Thought One Direction’s Formation Footage Would Never See The Light of Day</h2><p>Years ago, everybody was thanking and praising music mogul <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a> for bringing One Direction in the same stage. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">never-before-seen footage</a> that surfaced last July debunked that notion. It turns out, it was Scherzinger who must get all the credit for single handedly forming the group.</p><p>In her recent appearance with Sherri, the Pussycat Dolls star opened about the X Factor footage. According to her, she feels proud to have played a “small part” in One Direction’s fame.</p><p>“I never thought this footage would see the light of day, I thought Simon burned it,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “It’s really cool that it came out because what people are actually seeing is me like actually putting them together the way that my mind grapes were working.”</p><p>Talk show host Sherri Shepherd replied, saying that Cowell should be ashamed for grabbing Scherzinger’s credit. While the former guest judge laughed in response, she doesn’t seem to have deep grudge against the music mogul. She, however, jokingly asked for a commission fee.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-is-working-on-a-new-album>She is Working on a New Album</h2><p>Scherzinger also talked about the album she’s been working on for quite some time now. According to her, she feels it necessary to channel her emotions through music as a woman who has experienced a lot.</p><p>“It’s great to finally have the confidence to realize your own voice and to not be afraid to use it,” she said. “It’s very personal, it’s very real so y’all better watch out.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a> judge has not released a solo album since her dance-pop record “Big Fat Lie” in 2014. Consequently, she considers it a “real blessing” to get back on track. Today, she’s focused on creating empowering music again.</p><p>“My superpowers, I think, lie on the stage. So I’m writing a lot of things thinking live performances,” Scherzinger said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/KatyPerry_LukeBryan-220x165.jpg alt="Luke Bryan Gave Katy Perry “Country Education” After She Eavesdropped on His Facetime Call" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKaqKSVYsCktMSrsaKml5q%2FbsDHqKygoKRiwKq5zqdknKenmrmtecGuqaedlGLBqbGMn6aorJGcsm67xWamp51dmbazscKtoKimo2KzsL7Mmquip55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1561408-nedomade2023-funke-kuti-celebrates-son-weds-inedeoye-photos-trends.html><span>←</span><span>NedoMade2023: Funke Kuti Celebrates As Her Only Son, Made Weds Inedeoye, Photos Trends</span></a>
