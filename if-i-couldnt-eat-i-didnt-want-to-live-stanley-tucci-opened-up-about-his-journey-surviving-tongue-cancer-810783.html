And, of&nbsp;course, when you think that there might be&nbsp;something wrong, you’re also afraid that there is&nbsp;something wrong,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><p>It&nbsp;took seeing multiple doctors to&nbsp;finally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discover</a> that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;3-centimeter tumor at&nbsp;the base of&nbsp;his tongue: “They couldn’t do&nbsp;surgery because the tumor was so&nbsp;big. It’s a&nbsp;miracle that it&nbsp;didn’t metastasize. It&nbsp;had been in&nbsp;me&nbsp;so&nbsp;long.”</p><p><h2>Stanley Tucci’s first wife, Kate Tucci, died of&nbsp;breast cancer in&nbsp;2009.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c6d/d44/a020695dc7b664954d6f540a85.jpg><p>CJ Contino / Everett Collection / East News</p><p>The mass “was too big to&nbsp;operate” and could only be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>treated</a> with “high-dose radiation and chemo.”</p><p>Tucci, who lost his first wife, Kate, to&nbsp;breast cancer, was wary of&nbsp;this. “I’d vowed I’d never do&nbsp;anything like that because my&nbsp;first wife died of&nbsp;cancer, and to&nbsp;watch her go&nbsp;through those treatments for years was horrible,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>.</p><p><h2>Tucci shares a&nbsp;daughter and son with his wife, Felicity. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;father to&nbsp;3&nbsp;older children from his first marriage.</h2></p><p>Stanley went through a&nbsp;35-day radiation treatment plus 7&nbsp;sessions of&nbsp;chemotherapy, which ruined his sense of&nbsp;<a href=# title=taste data-link=tag>taste</a> and smell and left him unable to&nbsp;eat. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that his treatment involved the use of&nbsp;a&nbsp;feeding tube. “The kids were great, but it&nbsp;was hard for them. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;feeding tube for 6&nbsp;months. I&nbsp;could barely make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the twins’ high school graduation,” explained Tucci.</p><p><h2>The treatment had serious side effects.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10c/465/4769ed5dca80ad078664bc3412.jpg><p>Throughout the treatment, his greatest fear wasn’t death but rather the prospect of&nbsp;a&nbsp;life without taste. “I&nbsp;mean, if&nbsp;you can’t eat and enjoy food, how are you going to&nbsp;enjoy everything else?” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wondered</a>. Because of&nbsp;the radiation sessions, according to&nbsp;Tucci, all food <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tasted</a> like cardboard “slathered with someone’s excrement.”</p><p><h2>Felicity’s support helped him through one of&nbsp;the toughest times in&nbsp;his life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/916/680/5c31355ace950b34c1ac518522.jpg><p>After his treatments ended in&nbsp;2018, Tucci <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> slowly rebuilding his strength and ability to&nbsp;eat, which was “just the most exciting thing in&nbsp;the world” to&nbsp;him at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a> that the support of&nbsp;his wife, Felicity Blunt, was invaluable: “Felicity’s undying attention, affection, and encouragement got me&nbsp;through&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Tucci <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that there are some lingering complications from his treatment&nbsp;— some foods still taste “weird,” and spicy dishes are inedibly painful to&nbsp;eat. The star of&nbsp;the food and travel show, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Searching for Italy</i></a>, returned to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fuller lifestyle, enjoying his longtime passion for cooking and making drinks with friends and <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p>As&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>puts</a>&nbsp;it, “A&nbsp;perfect day off for me&nbsp;would be&nbsp;going to&nbsp;the farmer’s market, buying a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;food, start cooking, play with the kids. And then have people over for dinner. To&nbsp;me, that’s just a&nbsp;great day.”</p><p><h2>Cancer changed his life forever.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb5/47f/ad6af4527e81d9c140dcf19bb4.jpg><p>AFP / EAST NEWS</p><p>Now free of&nbsp;cancer, Tucci <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a> how the disease had changed his perspective on&nbsp;his own life, saying, “Cancer makes you more afraid and less afraid at&nbsp;the same time. I&nbsp;feel much older than&nbsp;I did before&nbsp;I was sick. But you still want to&nbsp;get ahead and get things done.”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;Stanley Tucci’s journey?
