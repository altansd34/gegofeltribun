According to her, she filmed the visualizer alongside her dancers and Mac Miller independently.</p><p>“[The label] brought it up to me, they were like, ‘We need to shoot a music video.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, we already did it,'” she said.</p><p>For those who may not know, Grande has been signed to Republic Records since 2011.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-had-one-song-in-yours-truly-she-wrote-by-herself>She Had One Song in Yours Truly She Wrote By Herself</h3><p>It’s no secret that Grande collaborated with several songwriters for Yours Truly, including Victoria Monet and Leon Thomas. Yet, there’s one song that Grande is proudly taking credit of alone. “Tattooed Heart” is arguably one of fans’ most favorite songs in the album and the only track the pop star wrote by herself.</p><p>“I wrote ‘Tattooed Heart’ in my room alone, when I think I was 17,” she said. “That’s, like, the only song on that album that I wrote by myself.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-yours-truly-almost-had-a-different-title>Yours Truly Almost Had a Different Title</h3><p>Like any other artists, Grande also struggled in decided what the name of her album should be. Before her debut album became Yours Truly, she was choosing between Honeymoon Avenue and Daydreamin’.</p><p>“I just wanted it to be sort of like a love letter, an introduction to the world. And how you sign a love letter type thing is ‘yours truly.’ It just felt like, ‘Here I am.'” she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-there-were-songs-she-wishes-could-ve-been-singles>There Were Songs She Wishes Could’ve Been Singles</h3><p>In the Q&A, one fan asked if she would want some of her tracks to have a single treatment. For her, “Honeymoon Avenue” and “You’ll Never Know” could be amazing as singles as well.</p><p>“‘Honeymoon Avenue’ and ‘You’ll Never Know,’ for sure,” she shared. “I think ‘You’ll Never Know’ would’ve been such a fun single.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-thought-the-original-album-cover-of-yours-truly-is-horrible>She Thought the Original Album Cover of Yours Truly is Horrible</h3><p>Before the cover of Yours Truly became an iconic black-and-white portrait, Yours Truly artwork was a</p><p>“Not horrible, it is — you were right,” she continued. “You guys got very angry when you saw it. I was very sad about that, and I changed it. Your bullying has been consistent for the past 10 years.

Now that she’s beginning to trek her 30’s, she knows what words of wisdom she’d give to her younger self.</p><p>“Stay present, and don’t be afraid to say no when you are running on empty and they are sending you around,” shared Grande. “Don’t be afraid to say no when you need rest.”</p><p>Yet, Grande believes it isn’t only her younger self that needs a message. In the same Q&A, the pop star stated what “Yours Truly Ari to say to Positions Ari.”</p><p>“‘Don’t let go of me,'” she added. “Don’t let them make you apologetic or want to shrink yourself.
