I&nbsp;learned from real life better.” </strong>For Kanye, “real life” meant rapping and collaborating with local artists. Feeling the pull of&nbsp;his music career, he&nbsp;boldly moved to&nbsp;<a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a> in&nbsp;2001.</p><p>Transitioning into adulthood brought both challenges and opportunities for Kanye. Graduating from Polaris High School marked a&nbsp;significant milestone, but it&nbsp;was just the beginning of&nbsp;his journey. His brief stint at&nbsp;art school provided him with valuable insights into creativity and expression. Still, Kanye soon realized that his true <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> would come from the streets, not the classroom.</p><p><strong>Leaving <a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a> wasn’t an&nbsp;easy decision for Kanye, but he&nbsp;trusted his instincts and followed his passion for music.</strong> His time in&nbsp;New York City was transformative.

The decision to&nbsp;halt the sale of&nbsp;Yeezy sneakers dealt a&nbsp;severe blow to&nbsp;both parties involved. <strong>For Kanye, it&nbsp;meant losing a&nbsp;significant platform for his footwear designs, while Adidas faced the challenge of&nbsp;repositioning its brand in&nbsp;the wake of&nbsp;the controversy.</strong></p><p>Despite the setback, the rapper remained undeterred in&nbsp;his pursuit of&nbsp;creative expression. He&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;explore new avenues for his fashion and design ventures, seeking partnerships and collaborations that aligned with his vision and values.</p><p><strong>The controversy surrounding Kanye’s remarks prompted a&nbsp;broader conversation about accountability and social responsibility within the fashion industry.</strong> Brands faced increased scrutiny over their associations with high-profile individuals and the potential impact on&nbsp;their reputation and bottom line.</p><p>In&nbsp;response to&nbsp;the public outcry, Adidas took proactive steps to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>address</a> the situation.<strong> By&nbsp;pledging a&nbsp;portion of&nbsp;Yeezy sales towards charity organizations, Adidas sought to&nbsp;mitigate the fallout from the controversy while reaffirming its commitment to&nbsp;social justice and inclusivity.</strong></p><p>Moving forward, both&nbsp;Ye and Adidas navigated the aftermath of&nbsp;the controversy with a&nbsp;renewed focus on&nbsp;integrity and accountability. While the road ahead may be&nbsp;challenging, the incident served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;catalyst for positive change within the industry, fostering greater awareness and dialogue around issues of&nbsp;prejudice and discrimination.</p><p><h2>What is&nbsp;Kanye West net worth now?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fc/6c7/49c72f58988b5248d02aecf298.jpg><p>PHOTOlink/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;2022, Kanye West’s wealth </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>peaked</strong></a><strong> at&nbsp;$2&nbsp;billion, earning him a&nbsp;spot on&nbsp;Forbes’ billionaires list.</strong> However, this changed drastically when Adidas severed ties with him.
