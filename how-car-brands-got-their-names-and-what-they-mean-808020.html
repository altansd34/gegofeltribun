The Mitsubishi logo, for example, consists of&nbsp;3&nbsp;diamonds which mean integrity, reliability, and success. And the Hyundai logo in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;slanted letter&nbsp;H is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;silhouette of&nbsp;2&nbsp;individuals shaking hands with each other.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;look into the <a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a> of&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;cars.</p><p><h2>1. KIA</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab3/324/7edb43505e885f7a852b16e1a3.jpg><p>Kia corporation was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>founded</a> in&nbsp;1944 and was originally known as&nbsp;Kyungsung Precision Industry. At&nbsp;the time, they specialized in&nbsp;the production of&nbsp;bicycles. Korea’s first domestic bicycle was assembled at&nbsp;the plant of&nbsp;this company. Later they switched to&nbsp;assembling motorcycles and didn’t begin to&nbsp;build cars until the 1970s. The name KIA can be&nbsp;translated as&nbsp;“rising from Asia.”</p><p><h2>2. Volvo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/999/735/1cec4c5e3ab97183a2c474dd2a.jpg><p>Volvo was supposed to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;daughter company of&nbsp;SKF, which was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>founded</a> in&nbsp;1907 and manufactured ball bearings. In&nbsp;1924, the company management decided to&nbsp;start building cars that could withstand the low temperatures and rough roads of&nbsp;Sweden. The recognizable Volvo logo is&nbsp;an&nbsp;ancient chemical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>symbol</a> for iron. By&nbsp;the way, this is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most ancient ideograms in&nbsp;Western culture. As&nbsp;for the name, “volvo” means “I&nbsp;roll” in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Latin</a>.</p><p><h2>3. Subaru</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4bc/19b/9969ba56ffb49a407bc5f6e64a.jpg><p>Subaru was previously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>known</a> as&nbsp;Fuji Heavy Industries. It&nbsp;was established in&nbsp;1915. Its founder and president wanted new cars to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;Japanese name and asked company employees to&nbsp;provide him with ideas. However, he&nbsp;didn’t like any of&nbsp;the proposals, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;use his own idea for the name. Subaru is&nbsp;the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster and also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>means</a> “unite.” And the 6&nbsp;stars in&nbsp;the logo illustrate the union of&nbsp;the 6&nbsp;companies that participated in&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;this brand.</p><p><h2>4. Mitsubishi</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e0b/4ce/1b908e59a39adbd57df3ea6b7d.jpg><p>The company was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>founded</a> by&nbsp;Iwasaki Yatarō in&nbsp;1870 and was originally a&nbsp;shipping firm. It&nbsp;received its current name in&nbsp;1873. The word “mitsubishi” consists of&nbsp;2&nbsp;parts, “mitsu” meaning “3” and “hishi” meaning “water chestnut,” but is&nbsp;also used to&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;a&nbsp;diamond. The Mitsubishi logo features 3&nbsp;diamonds which refer to&nbsp;both the 3&nbsp;oak leaves from the crest of&nbsp;the Yamauchi or&nbsp;Tosa family that ruled over the birthplace of&nbsp;the Mitsubishi founder and his father’s family crest, which consisted of&nbsp;3&nbsp;diamonds. These 3&nbsp;diamonds <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>represent</a> reliability, integrity, and success which were the core values of&nbsp;Iwasaki’s family.</p><p><h2>5. Audi</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/742/a22/8ae2505b789aa44899bca96119.jpg><p>The history of&nbsp;Audi <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dates</a> back to&nbsp;1909. The company name is&nbsp;the Latin translation of&nbsp;the surname of&nbsp;the founder, August Horch, which means “listen” in&nbsp;German. The idea to&nbsp;use the word “audi” as&nbsp;a&nbsp;trade name came from the son of&nbsp;Horch’s business partner, and was enthusiastically accepted by&nbsp;everyone involved.</p><p><h2>6. Lexus</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/641/40d/fd55af59eaab8c245de87b08b4.jpg><p>Lexus is&nbsp;a&nbsp;relatively young car brand. It&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>founded</a> in&nbsp;1989 by&nbsp;Eiji Toyoda who wanted to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;car for upper-class consumers. To&nbsp;better understand the needs of&nbsp;this segment, focus groups were conducted. The brand name was coined in&nbsp;1986. It&nbsp;was chosen from a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;219&nbsp;options. One of&nbsp;the front runners was the name Alexis but since it&nbsp;was associated with the character of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV show <i>Dynasty,</i> which was popular in&nbsp;the 1980s, it&nbsp;was decided to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;sound more modern resulting in&nbsp;the word Lexus. The brand creators stress that this word has no&nbsp;specific meaning, and implies a&nbsp;luxurious and technological image.</p><p><h2>7. Infiniti</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/319/57e/1641cf5b20bfedbd4a91d87fb8.jpg><p>Infiniti was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>founded</a> in&nbsp;Japan in&nbsp;1989. The brand name refers to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>endless</a> road a&nbsp;driver can overcome with this car. According to&nbsp;the creators, the Infiniti logo has a&nbsp;double meaning. An&nbsp;oval with a&nbsp;triangle inside <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>represents</a> a&nbsp;road extending into the horizon and the highest mountain in&nbsp;Japan, Mt. Fuji, emphasizing the Japanese origin of&nbsp;the car.</p><p><h2>8. Hyundai</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/821/a9d/d437e55beba6d354af46f2116c.jpg><p>The Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>founded</a> by&nbsp;South Korean businessman Chung Ju-Yung in&nbsp;1947. The first model of&nbsp;this brand was released in&nbsp;1968, and 17&nbsp;years later, the one millionth Hyundai car was built. The brand name <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>means</a> “modernity” in&nbsp;Korean, and the company’s slogan is&nbsp;<i>New Thinking. New Possibilities</i>. The car logo also has a&nbsp;meaning. The slanted&nbsp;H represents 2&nbsp;people shaking hands. One of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;a&nbsp;representative of&nbsp;the company, and the other one is&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer satisfied with the car’s quality.</p><p><h2>9. SsangYong</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2c/1b7/92a5145db79b12e5f6ba3f31be.jpg><p>SsangYong is&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>oldest</a> and fourth-largest car manufacturer in&nbsp;South Korea. This brand <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> out as&nbsp;2&nbsp;separate companies established in&nbsp;1954 and 1962. Initially, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>built</a> jeeps, trucks, and buses. In&nbsp;1988, Dong-A Motor changed its name to&nbsp;SsangYong Motor which means “2&nbsp;dragons” in&nbsp;Korean. The brand logo <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>resembles</a> 2&nbsp;dragons which represent self-sufficiency, independence, harmony, and infinity.</p><p><h2>10. Mazda</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36c/986/eb0ea05612b519d8cf735ac26b.jpg><p>The history of&nbsp;Mazda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> in&nbsp;1920. Initially, the future car manufacturer made corks. But in&nbsp;the 1930s, they began to&nbsp;build cars. In&nbsp;1984, the company formally adopted the Mazda name, although 3-wheeled trucks had been previously built under this brand.</p><p>The creators gave them the name of&nbsp;the Zoroastrian god of&nbsp;light Ahura Mazda with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hope</a> that it&nbsp;would improve the image of&nbsp;these compact vehicles. Also, the name of&nbsp;the brand was consistent with the name of&nbsp;the company president&nbsp;— Jujiro Matsuda. The Mazda logo <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>is</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;wings in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;the letter M.&nbsp;They represent creativity, vitality, kindness, and resilience.</p><p><h2>11. Jaguar</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc8/e39/cbf9b15bbca3de0041e2b59c3e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 1920s, Jaguar was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>known</a> as&nbsp;The Swallow Sidecar Company, S.S. for short, originally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>making</a> motorcycle sidecars. In&nbsp;1945, the shareholders, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;general meeting, agreed to&nbsp;change the company’s name to&nbsp;Jaguar. At&nbsp;the time, chairman William Lyons said, “Unlike&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. the name Jaguar is&nbsp;distinctive and cannot be&nbsp;connected or&nbsp;confused with any similar foreign name.” The cars with the leaping jaguar logo are strongly associated with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grace</a>, elegance, performance, and power.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you drive?
