Wanda Dench and Jamal Hinton’s <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> started thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;texting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mistake</a> years ago and is&nbsp;still going strong.

However, it&nbsp;didn’t reach the intended recipient because her grandson had changed his phone number. Instead, Jamal, 17&nbsp;at that time, got her message. The confused teenager asked the woman to&nbsp;send him a&nbsp;selfie to&nbsp;prove that she was not his grandma, which she gladly did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2a/ce9/6c2c3055e6adeaea5570f27b2b.jpg><p>Despite confirming that they didn’t know each other, Jamal asked Wanda if&nbsp;he&nbsp;could still join her and her family for Thanksgiving dinner, and she agreed. He&nbsp;then shared a&nbsp;screenshot of&nbsp;their conversation on&nbsp;Instagram, and the story instantly went viral. “She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lovely lady,” Jamal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> after meeting Wanda for the first time. “She told me&nbsp;she’s used to&nbsp;having a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people over. I&nbsp;just got a&nbsp;vibe from her that made me&nbsp;feel at&nbsp;home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e71/d8f/79608e5fd79b2ca55ebb5349d9.jpg><p>Their bond grew stronger over the years, and Wanda could rely on&nbsp;Jamal and his girlfriend, Mikaela, for support when her husband passed away last year. She says that Jamal is&nbsp;her ’’heart for life," adding that he&nbsp;has changed her outlook on&nbsp;friendships and age gaps. ’’He’s literally changed my&nbsp;life and my&nbsp;point of&nbsp;view on&nbsp;young generations about being open to&nbsp;friendships when you think you have nothing in&nbsp;common with somebody," Dench <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/267/72e/11a01855099a1cb06113d3ef11.jpg><p>Aside from their traditional Thanksgiving dinner, Wanda and Jamal are in&nbsp;constant contact throughout the year. “It’s amazing to&nbsp;have her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend and as&nbsp;my&nbsp;family. The cameras and the fame can stop tomorrow, and nothing is&nbsp;changing between&nbsp;us,” Jamal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/552/5a6/e53a5951b5a4cf775c5031aba3.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d40/c78/ea7cde57ef8ceda17dcdcf08e5.jpg><p>This September, Jamal accompanied Wanda to&nbsp;get her first <a href=# title=tattoo data-link=tag>tattoo</a>. “I&nbsp;got 3&nbsp;shooting stars. Each one represents my&nbsp;guardian angels in&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;— my&nbsp;husband who stands for integrity, my&nbsp;mother who was courageous, and my&nbsp;father who was about unconditional love,” she explained. Jamal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a> he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;great time keeping her company. With this year’s Thanksgiving <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>update</a>, Jamal shared the news that he&nbsp;and Wanda are starting a&nbsp;business venture together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/833/33d/e12dc75655a4e355a22ce2631b.jpg><p>And if&nbsp;you thought that their unlikely friendship would make for a&nbsp;good movie, you are right.
