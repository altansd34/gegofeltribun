Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have proposed legislation to impose levies on the richest people in the country as a way to battle economic inequality. Between the two proposals, Warren’s wealth tax is the more popular among voters, according to a new Morning Consult/Politico survey. Sixty-one percent of the 1,993 voters surveyed in the Feb. 1-2 poll favored Warren’s “ultra-millionaire” plan, which is an annual tax of 2 percent on household wealth more than $50 million and a 3 percent levy on wealth in excess of $1 billion.</description></item><item><title>When to use informal and formal German- Lingoda</title><link>/when-to-use-informal-and-formal-german.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/when-to-use-informal-and-formal-german.html</guid><description>Germans have a reputation of being serious and quite reserved, which you can also see in the language… and what shall I say?!

Dabei wird die alte Kurzform für das noch ältere God be with you (Gott sei mit dir) im englischen Sprachraum eher selten gebraucht. Sowohl in förmlichen als auch in informellen Situationen gibt es eine Vielzahl anderer Möglichkeiten, sich auf Englisch zu verabschieden. Welche die richtige ist, hängt zum einen davon ab, wie gut du und dein Gegenüber euch kennt.</description></item><item><title>15 saludos y despedidas en ingls</title><link>/saludos-despedidas-en-ingles.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/saludos-despedidas-en-ingles.html</guid><description>¿Quieres ir más allá del hello o bye y conocer otros saludos y despedidas en inglés?

The tastes that we&amp;nbsp;have as&amp;nbsp;grownups are forged from an&amp;nbsp;early age, and that is&amp;nbsp;when we&amp;nbsp;become fanatical about different kinds of&amp;nbsp;things. We&amp;nbsp;dream that when we&amp;nbsp;are adults, we&amp;nbsp;will buy everything that our parents could not give&amp;nbsp;us at&amp;nbsp;the time. Sometimes we&amp;nbsp;even look for our little piggy bank to&amp;nbsp;save money and make our dreamed-about object a&amp;nbsp;reality.

It’s thanks to&amp;nbsp;them that things like outward-turned feet and special hand positions appeared that were originally used in&amp;nbsp;fencing&amp;nbsp;— the not-so-convenient position of&amp;nbsp;the feet helped the fencing fighter easily turn to&amp;nbsp;any side.
Nevertheless, nowadays there is&amp;nbsp;still a&amp;nbsp;stereotype saying that ballet is&amp;nbsp;more of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;female activity. We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side decided to&amp;nbsp;check and see how valid this opinion&amp;nbsp;is, and we&amp;nbsp;found out a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;interesting things.
A&amp;nbsp;man who performs in&amp;nbsp;ballet dances is&amp;nbsp;called a&amp;nbsp;ballet dancer, a&amp;nbsp;danseur, or&amp;nbsp;ballerino.</description></item><item><title>20 Riddles to Test Your Logic and Train Your Brain</title><link>/20-riddles-to-test-your-logic-and-train-your-brain-802148.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/20-riddles-to-test-your-logic-and-train-your-brain-802148.html</guid><description>Emoji riddles became popular for being an&amp;nbsp;easy and smart way to&amp;nbsp;play with family and friends online.

The 25-year-old beauty mogul has been open about her fear of&amp;nbsp;aging many times.

In the 14th century it is thought a ferocious sandstorm largely buried the structure, before it was excavated by archaeologists in the early 1990s.&amp;nbsp;
So unique is the monument that a reconstruction of two of the court’s buildings, styled to look as they did in the 13th century, were added to the open-air St Fagans National Museum of History in 2018.</description></item><item><title>Marjorie Harvey's net worth (2024)?

Or&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;we’ve always been told... But new research has come to&amp;nbsp;light that debunks this theory. On&amp;nbsp;April 15th, 1915, Titanic, the biggest ship of&amp;nbsp;its time, completely disappeared under the ice-cold surface of&amp;nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean. It’s hard to&amp;nbsp;believe that such a&amp;nbsp;massive and expensive creation could be&amp;nbsp;destroyed by&amp;nbsp;one simple iceberg, right? Well, recent findings suggest that the real cause of&amp;nbsp;the disaster was a&amp;nbsp;fire, not an&amp;nbsp;iceberg.

In&amp;nbsp;fact, this term first appeared in&amp;nbsp;London around the twentieth century, used to&amp;nbsp;describe highly popular women in&amp;nbsp;society. But it&amp;nbsp;wasn’t until the ’80s and ’90s, when modern TVs started appearing in&amp;nbsp;everyone’s homes, that these “it&amp;nbsp;girls” started to&amp;nbsp;gain massive celebrity status. Everyone who grew up&amp;nbsp;back then either wanted to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;like them or&amp;nbsp;wanted to&amp;nbsp;date them.
So&amp;nbsp;let’s take a&amp;nbsp;trip down memory lane and let Bright Side lead&amp;nbsp;us on&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;journey to&amp;nbsp;find out how these women look today and what they’re up&amp;nbsp;to.</description></item><item><title>What Can Happen to Your Body If You Sleep With a Pillow Between Your Knees</title><link>/what-can-happen-to-your-body-if-you-sleep-with-a-pillow-between-your-knees-804319.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-can-happen-to-your-body-if-you-sleep-with-a-pillow-between-your-knees-804319.html</guid><description>Bedtime is&amp;nbsp;probably one of&amp;nbsp;the moments we&amp;nbsp;look forward to&amp;nbsp;the most at&amp;nbsp;the end of&amp;nbsp;the day.

The Titanic crashed into a&amp;nbsp;huge iceberg and sank. Yep we’ve covered that. But what if&amp;nbsp;this time we&amp;nbsp;use the ice to&amp;nbsp;bring the ship to&amp;nbsp;the surface? This requires several thousand feet of&amp;nbsp;wire mesh and a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;liquid nitrogen. Our goal is&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;put the Titanic in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;huge block of&amp;nbsp;ice that will raise the ship to&amp;nbsp;the surface.
To&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;this, you need to&amp;nbsp;wrap the wreck in&amp;nbsp;the wire mesh and cover it&amp;nbsp;with liquid nitrogen.

In&amp;nbsp;some cases, however, the fear we&amp;nbsp;see on&amp;nbsp;screen is&amp;nbsp;very real and we&amp;nbsp;might not even know&amp;nbsp;it. What’s even more challenging is&amp;nbsp;when actors need to&amp;nbsp;overcome their own phobias to&amp;nbsp;film a&amp;nbsp;scene, and we&amp;nbsp;applaud every single one of&amp;nbsp;them.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side dove deep into actors’ struggles on&amp;nbsp;set and gained a&amp;nbsp;new level of&amp;nbsp;admiration for their work.

And today, many famous women follow the examples of&amp;nbsp;these successful ladies. Kylie Minogue, Charlize Theron, and Emilia Clarke have never been married and can hardly imagine themselves as&amp;nbsp;wives.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side found out who among very popular and beautiful women decided not to&amp;nbsp;tie the knot and have no&amp;nbsp;regrets.
Charlize Theron, 46&amp;nbsp;years old
Charlize Theron has never been married and is&amp;nbsp;not going&amp;nbsp;to.</description></item><item><title>14 Times Movie Creators Didnt Bother and Used the Same Costumes in Different Films</title><link>/14-times-movie-creators-didnt-bother-and-used-the-same-costumes-in-different-films-766610.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/14-times-movie-creators-didnt-bother-and-used-the-same-costumes-in-different-films-766610.html</guid><description>“Why spend money on&amp;nbsp;new things when we&amp;nbsp;can use the old ones?” was probably the mindset of&amp;nbsp;movie makers when they decided to&amp;nbsp;use costumes that had already been used in&amp;nbsp;previous movies. Most films and&amp;nbsp;TV series just don’t have enough money to&amp;nbsp;dress the entire cast in&amp;nbsp;entirely new costumes. And if&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;dress was especially good (like it&amp;nbsp;was in&amp;nbsp;Titanic) why not take the chance and use it&amp;nbsp;again?
Bright Side has chosen several examples of&amp;nbsp;when characters from different movies wore the exact same clothes.</description></item><item><title>15 Wild Animals That People Found a Place for in Their Homes and Their Hearts</title><link>/15-wild-animals-that-people-found-a-place-for-in-their-homes-and-their-hearts-797443.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/15-wild-animals-that-people-found-a-place-for-in-their-homes-and-their-hearts-797443.html</guid><description>From a&amp;nbsp;rescued cow enjoying regular bubble baths, to&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;wild fox cozily cuddling with a&amp;nbsp;dog in&amp;nbsp;their owner’s bed, to&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;injured kangaroo living happily together with its owners&amp;nbsp;— these are just a&amp;nbsp;few examples of&amp;nbsp;how people happened to&amp;nbsp;share their homes and hugs with animals who were born to&amp;nbsp;live in&amp;nbsp;the wild.

Thousands of&amp;nbsp;those infected do&amp;nbsp;not seek treatment, so&amp;nbsp;keep on&amp;nbsp;reading to&amp;nbsp;make sure that you know what to&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;you should ever come across this kind of&amp;nbsp;situation in&amp;nbsp;the future.

Even though most children as&amp;nbsp;young as&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;years old understand the concept of&amp;nbsp;unsafe and safe touch, getting into details without a&amp;nbsp;plan can make things go&amp;nbsp;sideways. If&amp;nbsp;it’s not handled carefully it&amp;nbsp;can confuse your kid and they might end up&amp;nbsp;with more questions than answers. Once they learn about the difference, your kid will be&amp;nbsp;able to&amp;nbsp;react accordingly and inform you in&amp;nbsp;time, before things go&amp;nbsp;the wrong way.</description></item><item><title>70+ favourite Beth Dutton's quotes and sayings from Yellowstone</title><link>/1463502-70-favorite-beth-dutton-quotes-sayings-yellowstone.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/1463502-70-favorite-beth-dutton-quotes-sayings-yellowstone.html</guid><description>Kelly Reilly is an English actress best known for her appearance in the television series Yellowstone as Beth Dutton.

These studies opened a&amp;nbsp;door to&amp;nbsp;the mysteries of&amp;nbsp;the human body. And over time, the body continues to&amp;nbsp;fascinate&amp;nbsp;us.

It’s curious to&amp;nbsp;learn how different the way of&amp;nbsp;life for women in&amp;nbsp;Japanese society is&amp;nbsp;compared to&amp;nbsp;what Western women are used&amp;nbsp;to.

When trust is broken in such an intimate context, it can lead to profound emotional pain and damage the foundation of the relationship. A poignant example surfaced recently on Reddit, where a husband poured out his anguish upon uncovering years of deceit.
He wrote:
