While many parents stick to&nbsp;traditional methods of&nbsp;raising their children, some famous families have adopted unusual and unconventional parenting techniques.

Pink</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6fd/b9a/59f95551cca4a542cf5745a565.jpg><p>“My&nbsp;kids don’t have a&nbsp;phone, and my&nbsp;daughter is&nbsp;the only 11-year-old in&nbsp;her class that doesn’t have one,” <a href=# title=Pink data-link=tag>Pink</a> said. “It’s hard. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends have their kids on&nbsp;TikTok, and&nbsp;I don’t.” There’s only one way for her daughter to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;phone anytime soon. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>: “I&nbsp;told her, point-blank, ’If you can produce literature from a&nbsp;reputable source that tells me&nbsp;that <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> is&nbsp;good for you, then you can be&nbsp;on&nbsp;it. Otherwise, good luck.’”</p><p>When Pink goes on&nbsp;tour this summer, her 11-year-old daughter Willow will be&nbsp;coming along as&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;her team. As&nbsp;per the singer’s statement, her daughter will be&nbsp;employed by&nbsp;her. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Pink said</a>: “We&nbsp;just had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;over minimum wage, and it’s different state to&nbsp;state.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;said it’s about $22.50&nbsp;a show depending on&nbsp;how long I&nbsp;go, if&nbsp;I run over. She goes, ‘I’ll take $20, it’s easier to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the math.’ I’m like, ‘That’s not how you negotiate for yourself.’ I’m like, ‘You’ll take $25, so&nbsp;it’s easier math.’”</p><p><h2>2. Jessica Alba &&nbsp;Cash Warren</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/342/0da/8c94ab5f8e9e31719ff1385ad3.jpg><p>When children behave badly, parents often use various punishments like sending them to&nbsp;their room, not allowing them to&nbsp;have dessert, or&nbsp;taking away their internet privileges. However, in&nbsp;Jessica’s household, the punishment is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit different. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;child misbehaves, they have to&nbsp;stand facing the wall until they are released.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave an&nbsp;example</a> to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us get a&nbsp;better idea of&nbsp;the situation: “So&nbsp;now it’s, ‘Stand in&nbsp;the corner and put your nose against the wall!’” Alba says. “My&nbsp;2-year-old can last 15&nbsp;seconds before she’s like, ‘Okay, I’m done!’ and then I’m like, ‘Wait, it’s not up&nbsp;to&nbsp;you!’ My&nbsp;5-year-old can go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;while, like a&nbsp;minute or&nbsp;2.”</p><p><h2>3. Candace Cameron Bure &&nbsp;Val Bure</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6fa/255/38eaf550e1b014543243c2d54d.jpg><p>Cameron got candid and revealed that she’s kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict mom.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>She said</a>: “They would also describe me&nbsp;as&nbsp;strict. I’m the mom that needs to&nbsp;meet the parents before my&nbsp;kids can go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new friend’s house. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;know who they’re with, where they’re going. Even now that they’re driving, I&nbsp;want them to&nbsp;text me&nbsp;when they arrive and when they’re heading home. We&nbsp;work hard to&nbsp;keep our <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> open and talk through any situation. I&nbsp;am always willing to&nbsp;listen. But, I&nbsp;don’t always say yes.”</p><p><h2>4. Sarah Michelle Gellar &&nbsp;Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/23d/630/2e560e52d184622ec96912c8a1.jpg><p>The couple says they have 100 rules for their children that are “strict as&nbsp;hell,” and they have to&nbsp;follow them. The rules include no&nbsp;phones at&nbsp;the dinner table and no&nbsp;social media accounts. Freddie explained where his strictness comes from.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>He&nbsp;said</a>: “Look, I&nbsp;don’t believe in&nbsp;whooping kids. I’ve never whooped mine. My&nbsp;mom whooped&nbsp;me. They were, like, preventative whoopings, so&nbsp;I know how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;strict.”</p><p><h2>5. Denzel Washington</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d5/6b4/2058be5b0c86ad53ddee3f88ea.jpg><p>Denzel said he&nbsp;was intentionally a&nbsp;very strict dad because he&nbsp;believed free will is&nbsp;a&nbsp;catch-22. “I&nbsp;think children are born good. But a&nbsp;child doesn’t know right from wrong, so&nbsp;moral instruction is&nbsp;important,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;said</a>.</p><p>He&nbsp;also mentioned: “I&nbsp;remember my&nbsp;eldest boy saying, ’Dad, I&nbsp;always thought you were so&nbsp;strict, now&nbsp;I appreciate it.’ Free will can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;double-edged sword. By&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;21, my&nbsp;son could see that.”</p><p><h2>6. Chip Gaines</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/050/3ae/b1bf7e56c0bab1203e85ae9f4c.jpg><p>Chip revealed that he’s stricter than he&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;be. “I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;environment that was pretty much ’back by&nbsp;dark.’ My&nbsp;parents didn’t generally know what we&nbsp;were doing, and it&nbsp;was all good, clean fun. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought, ’Oh, I’m gonna be&nbsp;a&nbsp;wild parent,’” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;explained</a>.</p><p>“And when&nbsp;I got to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent, I&nbsp;don’t know what it&nbsp;is&nbsp;about&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I feel a&nbsp;little bit like a&nbsp;drill sergeant sometimes.”</p><p><h2>7. Kelly Ripa</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/443/b9e/6d5a1c51fc828ad554dea925df.jpg><p>Strict parenting often involves being unequivocal about the fact that we&nbsp;are not meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;our children’s friends. Kelly Ripa believes in&nbsp;this approach, and she said that she was never hesitant to&nbsp;enforce any of&nbsp;her rules.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>she gave an&nbsp;example</a>: “She recently lost her computer and phone privileges, so&nbsp;it’s like taking away oxygen.” She also said at&nbsp;the time: “I&nbsp;don’t think she likes&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I don’t care. I’m like, ’I’m not your friend! I’m your mom.’”</p><p><h2>8. <strong></strong>Blake Lively &&nbsp;Ryan Reynolds</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a46/46a/8501335891b709e4200f2560d7.jpg><p>AXELLE / BAUER-GRIFFIN / East News</p><p>Blake Lively &&nbsp;Ryan Reynolds avoid using male pronouns around their children. This might seem strange at&nbsp;first, but they explained why to&nbsp;clear up&nbsp;the confusion. It&nbsp;appears that the couple intends to&nbsp;raise their children in&nbsp;an&nbsp;environment that is&nbsp;not gender-specific.</p><p>The couple also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave the name</a> ‘James’ to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their daughters hoping to&nbsp;teach them about gender equality. “Right now, my&nbsp;daughter thinks there’s no&nbsp;difference between her and a&nbsp;boy. She can do&nbsp;anything he&nbsp;can&nbsp;do. She has every opportunity that he&nbsp;has. She doesn’t learn anything different.”</p><p><h2>9. Cardi&nbsp;B</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95e/3f8/157cf65e15852f574f9bd7f817.jpg><p>Cardi B&nbsp;has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> that her daughter Kulture won’t be&nbsp;having sleepovers with friends. Despite her own rebellious nature as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, Cardi’s mother had a&nbsp;similar rule which Cardi would often break. However, after experiencing a&nbsp;challenging life and getting into trouble in&nbsp;the past, Cardi now understands the reasoning behind her mother’s decision and has chosen to&nbsp;apply the same rule to&nbsp;her daughter.</p><p><h2>10. Kim Kardashian</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d33/b7e/f53b475b54bda72a7d85552cb3.jpg><p>Kim Kardashian’s children are expected to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress fashionably</a>. They are only allowed to&nbsp;dress in&nbsp;the latest styles and carefully coordinated outfits in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;photo-ready at&nbsp;all times. The little Kardashians have to&nbsp;work the paparazzi just as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;the adults.</p><p>If&nbsp;you found these unusual parenting methods intriguing, we&nbsp;have more exciting articles for you to&nbsp;explore.
