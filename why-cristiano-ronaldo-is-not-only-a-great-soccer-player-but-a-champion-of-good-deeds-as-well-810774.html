In&nbsp;2012, he&nbsp;revealed the main reason he&nbsp;avoids putting ink under his skin: “I&nbsp;don’t have tattoos because&nbsp;I donate blood very often.”</p><p>It&nbsp;all started with his former teammate, Carlos Martins. He&nbsp;told Ronaldo that his son needed regular blood and bone marrow transfusions, and Ronaldo was quick to&nbsp;volunteer. Since then, he&nbsp;has become a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>frequent donor</a> and encourages many others to&nbsp;donate too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e08/418/0e6f64528ca666ab7023cbf866.jpg><p>People with tattoos are actually allowed to&nbsp;give blood too. But new tattoos can affect donations and cause a&nbsp;precautionary waiting period of&nbsp;anywhere between 6&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;months. Ronaldo realized that his help may be&nbsp;needed today, and every minute matters, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided not to&nbsp;take any risks in&nbsp;waiting so&nbsp;long.</p><p>In&nbsp;2015, he&nbsp;said, “We&nbsp;can all make a&nbsp;difference by&nbsp;donating blood. Each donation can benefit up&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;people in&nbsp;emergency situations and long-term medical treatments. That’s why I&nbsp;am enthusiastic to&nbsp;bring awareness to&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;blood donation and to&nbsp;encourage people around the world to&nbsp;become lifelong blood donors and help <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>save lives</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e0d/d35/95d9e25adeb1272103d5b1e04f.jpg><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bone marrow</a> donations, many people think it&nbsp;is&nbsp;something that is&nbsp;challenging to&nbsp;do. But Ronaldo himself says it’s nothing more than drawing blood and it&nbsp;doesn’t hurt. “I&nbsp;did it&nbsp;many years ago,” he&nbsp;said, “and if&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again, I&nbsp;would because this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very serious disease for many children, and we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;help them.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;helped a&nbsp;7-year-old tsunami survivor to&nbsp;rebuild his family’s house and paid for the boy’s education.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebc/b65/905ac3515d83705cf371f9699a.jpg><p>Little <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Martunis </a>was just 7&nbsp;when huge waves formed due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive underwater earthquake on&nbsp;December&nbsp;26, 2004, hitting the beaches of&nbsp;Banda Aceh in&nbsp;Indonesia. Martunis was separated from his family but managed to&nbsp;survive the tsunami.</p><p>He&nbsp;stayed alive by&nbsp;crawling on&nbsp;sinking objects, one after another. Then he&nbsp;clung to&nbsp;a&nbsp;big tree floating in&nbsp;the water, bringing him to&nbsp;the seafront. He&nbsp;survived for 3&nbsp;weeks on&nbsp;his own before reuniting with his only surviving relative, his father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/253/cbd/b2fea5551aa87cdcf3238d0dc0.jpg><p>Since Martunis was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>playing soccer</a> right before the waves took him away, he&nbsp;was found wearing the Portugal shirt with Ronaldo’s name on&nbsp;it. The picture of&nbsp;the little survivor went viral. Martunis’s story so&nbsp;deeply inspired Ronaldo that he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;help the boy.</p><p>The soccer star reportedly paid for Martunis’s <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a>, and the entire Portugal team gave money to&nbsp;help rebuild his family’s home. The boy met his hero 3&nbsp;years later, and at&nbsp;the time, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ronaldo </a>said, “I&nbsp;believe that many adults would not even be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;deal with what he&nbsp;has gone through.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;sold his European Golden Boot to&nbsp;raise funds and build several schools in&nbsp;Gaza.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb7/654/726b905012a48213b20a085f3a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2011, Ronaldo was awarded the European Golden Boot. And instead of&nbsp;keeping the award as&nbsp;another memorable trophy, he&nbsp;sold it&nbsp;at&nbsp;an&nbsp;auction and raised a&nbsp;stunning $1.2&nbsp;million. All of&nbsp;the funds were put toward building several <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>schools </a>in&nbsp;Gaza.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf6/cb4/08098e5bcbbe72e239d2cb4dc5.jpg><p><h2>He&nbsp;often helps his young fans.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fd/210/70ddb15885aaa393b38bee00cd.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2009, he&nbsp;heard about Nuhuzet Guillen’s story, a&nbsp;9-year-old boy with terminal cancer. Ronaldo sent a&nbsp;driver to&nbsp;bring the boy’s whole family to&nbsp;the hotel where he&nbsp;and his team were staying at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>He&nbsp;joked around with the boy right after he&nbsp;emerged from the elevator, saying, “Don’t you want to&nbsp;say anything?” And then he&nbsp;invited the boy to&nbsp;watch the match in&nbsp;his private box. He&nbsp;even dedicated his goal to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Guillen </a>and gave him his shirt after the match.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/72c/c73/8c15de5663b5c0238c1858248d.jpg><p>Ronaldo then spoke to&nbsp;the boy’s father. Unfortunately, there was not much that could be&nbsp;done in&nbsp;his condition. However, there was an&nbsp;experimental treatment in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US that Ronaldo decided to&nbsp;pay for.</p><p>He&nbsp;also offered to&nbsp;pay for all the boy’s medications and treatments at&nbsp;a&nbsp;private medical center and did so&nbsp;for more than a&nbsp;year. But <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Guillen’s </a>condition worsened anyway, and he&nbsp;sadly passed away in&nbsp;March 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf5/318/c6d7555ecdb43157bb7757197b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2014, he&nbsp;helped another young fan. His mother asked Ronaldo to&nbsp;donate a&nbsp;shirt to&nbsp;her 10-month-old, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Erik Ortiz Cruz</a>, who had cortical dysplasia. Ronaldo paid for the initial brain surgery and offered to&nbsp;cover the cost of&nbsp;any follow-up treatments. Although, this time, no&nbsp;further treatment was needed, and everything went just fine.</p><p>All in&nbsp;all, Ronaldo loves to&nbsp;interact with and help his supporters, especially children. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;once said, “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Children </a>are and will always be&nbsp;the best thing the world has to&nbsp;offer, and we&nbsp;must protect them at&nbsp;all costs. Supporters are and will always be&nbsp;the best&nbsp;in [soccer], and we&nbsp;must respect everything they face and endure.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2f2/197/195d8558de97eabd014a07aed5.jpg><p>Going back to&nbsp;the times when Ronaldo was a&nbsp;child himself, he&nbsp;still hasn’t forgotten 3&nbsp;women who gave him food back then. And he&nbsp;hasn’t given up&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>searching</a> for them, hoping to&nbsp;pay them back for all their kindness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6fb/794/b9a4de5218a29ca34d6e097a9b.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYycqaKrpJ6ur7uMq6anmZyZvG610malqKxdpLutxYyaZKCqlZbBbr%2FOnJqeql2luaLFxKtkm62kYq5ur8eapKmhn6N6sLKMoKaonF2Zsqaw0maYrGWnmrmteZdqZ3BvZGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-who-speak-french.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Who Speak French - Lingoda</span></a>
