However, the relationship between Paul and Meadow’s mother, Rebecca Soteros, was not that great, and the couple didn’t get married. Rebecca relocated to&nbsp;Hawaii right before Meadow was born. Paul was separated from his child for her entire childhood and teen years and was deeply concerned about&nbsp;it.</p><p>“My&nbsp;heart was desperate for so&nbsp;many years with the situation with my&nbsp;daughter,” Paul <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><p><h2>But he&nbsp;was still trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;involved.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/24a/d4b/7beab15616ba048179a5366e47.png><p>On&nbsp;rare occasions when Paul had the chance to&nbsp;meet up&nbsp;with Meadow, he&nbsp;made sure it&nbsp;was quality time they were spending together. “He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;make the most of&nbsp;every single moment with Meadow. He&nbsp;was completely dedicated,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> the actor’s manager, who witnessed Paul’s struggle between his overloaded career and the desire to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good father.</p><p>Paul and Meadow went on&nbsp;<a href=# title=camping data-link=tag>camping</a> trips together when she was a&nbsp;child, and Paul <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a> that it&nbsp;was essential to&nbsp;him “that she experiences those things and grows while doing all that.” Paul aimed to&nbsp;show Meadow the real side of&nbsp;things, “to&nbsp;make the outdoors a&nbsp;key part of&nbsp;her life,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p><h2>Paul wanted to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;his career at&nbsp;its peak for his daughter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ee8/a32/f491ec5cffa99c7bee83c0ac29.jpg><p>After the tragic accident that took Paul’s life, his father, Paul Walker&nbsp;Sr., revealed that his son was ready to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;his Hollywood career and passion for fast cars to&nbsp;dedicate the next several years of&nbsp;his life to&nbsp;Meadow. Paul was incredibly proud of&nbsp;her and “wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for her as&nbsp;she grew&nbsp;up,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> Walker Sr. “In&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;would’ve swapped his Hollywood fame for the quiet life with Meadow. Paul wasn’t big on&nbsp;fame and preferred to&nbsp;live modestly.”</p><p>Paul revealed his plans to&nbsp;his father several weeks before he&nbsp;passed, and, unfortunately, he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;make his dreams come true.</p><p><h2>Meadow had a&nbsp;hard time overcoming her loss.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9af/767/b5f6465fafa68ffdf56ab324e3.png><p>Meadow and all their relatives were shocked by&nbsp;what had happened.
