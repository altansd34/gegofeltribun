According to BrandIndex, which tracks perception of brands, all of the big four are in a worse position today than they were at the beginning of last year, apart from Asda, which has held steady. Meanwhile, Aldi’s overall Index score (a composite of six key measures of brand health) has risen a whopping 10 points over the same period, and Lidl is up six points.</p><p>Both Aldi’s and Lidl’s Index scores are four points higher among Morrisons shoppers than the general population, leaving little ambiguity as to who is benefiting from the shop’s decline.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Aldi20Lidl20BIX.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Morrisons shoppers are also more likely to say that Aldi and Lidl offer good value than are other consumers.</p><p><a href=#>Waitrose</a> has also had strong sales growth, which BrandIndex indicates could be powered by Sainsbury’s shoppers who view the brand considerably more positively than others. Waitrose has an Index score of 32 nationally, which rises to 47 when we filter for those who mostly shop at Sainsbury’s.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Waitrose20BIX.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnaWWEeHnCoZyaqJWnerTBz56pppmioLK1ecGrmKeco2Kus7GMqKytnpyWu6y1zaBkpqeip7a0uw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./castillos-en-gales.html><span>←</span><span>Castillos galeses | Wales.com</span></a>
