Her husband is three years younger than her</h3><p class=align-left>Sheryl’s husband, Rob, was born on March 17 1964, making him three years younger than his wife.

She ‘met’ her husband thrice</h3><p class=align-left>The two first met on set for a film in 1980 and dated for a few years. They then broke up and met again, this time on a blind date.
