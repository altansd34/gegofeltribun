<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>How to get your social security number in Germany</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>One of the first things your German employer will ask you for is your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sozialversicherungsnummer</a>, your social insurance number. It allows your employer to make your pension contributions, and should you leave Germany, you’ll also need it to claim those funds as well. It’s worth noting that this is different from your tax ID, which you will also need for your employer.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-the-social-security-number-in-Germany-and-how-do-I-get-one?>What is the social security number in Germany and how do I get one?</h2><p>Much like the Social Security Number in the US and the National Insurance Number in the UK, the German Sozialversicherungsnummer allows an employer to make the necessary pension contributions for you. It is also sometimes called a Rentenversicherungnummer, SV-Nummer, RNVR, or Versicherungsnummer, although this last one can also refer to your health insurance number, so double check which one you’re being asked for.&nbsp;</p><p>When you apply for public health insurance, you will get your Sozialversicherungsnummer automatically. If you have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">private health insurance</a>, you will need to apply for it separately from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deutsche Rentenversicherung</a>. Once you’ve requested it, your Sozialversicherungsausweis, your social security card, will arrive in the mail in about two weeks, but can take up to six. If you need your number in a hurry, you can go to a Deutsche Rentenversicherung office in person and you will receive it that day.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-do-I-need-to-get-a-German-social-security-number?>What do I need to get a German social security number?</h2><p>You will need a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">residence permit</a>, so you will need to have completed your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anmeldung</a>. You don’t need to be employed yet to get your social security number, and a company can employ you and pay you, before you’ve received yours. Just be sure to inform your employer as soon as you receive your number.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Is-the-German-social-security-number-the-same-as-the-tax-ID-number?>Is the German social security number the same as the tax ID number?</h2><p>No, your social security number is not the same as your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tax ID number</a>, and they are issued by different government departments. But your employer will need both of these numbers from you. Your tax ID, or Steueridentifikationsnummer (IdNr), is issued by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Federal Central Tax Office</a>, Bundeszentralamt für Steuern.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-do-I-apply-for-my-social-security-number-online?>How do I apply for my social security number online?</h2><p>If you sign up for public health insurance, you will automatically be registered for your social security number. The big public health insurance organizations are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Techniker Krankenkasse</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barmer</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AOK</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DAK</a>. In some cases, your employer may apply for you, and you will receive your details in the mail. If you need to apply yourself, you can do so online at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deutsche Rentenversicherung</a> (German). The process is in German, and you will need:</p><ul><li>Your resident permit or ID card with the activated online ID function</li><li>Smartphone with NFC</li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AusweisApp2</a> on your smartphone</li><li>Computer running Windows or macOS and the AusweisApp2 (optional)</li></ul><p>If you’ve been using a health insurance broker to source your private health insurance, sometimes they will get this process started for you, so it’s worth asking about it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Getting your German social security number: You can do it!</h2><p>There is an overwhelming amount of unfamiliar paperwork involved when you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">move to Germany</a>, but just take it one step at a time and you’ll get there. You can request your social security number from your public health insurer or the Deutsche Rentenversicherung if you’ve lost track of it, and it will also be on your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">paystub</a> from your employer if you are a salaried employee. The good news is you will only have to do this once, as your social security number is for life.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Erin-2-2.jpeg><h2>Erin McGann</h2><p>Erin McGann is a Canadian freelance writer focusing on travel, living abroad, parenting, history, and culture.
