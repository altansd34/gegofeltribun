You’ll need to read tomorrow’s report to understand which voter groups she needs to make up ground with, with a focus on age, race and ideology. But for today’s newsletter, I want to focus on Trump’s number, which is up 3 points from where it was at this time four years ago.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">How you interpret this shift says a lot about how you view the race.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Are there still shy Trump voters?</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Trump has consistently outperformed his polling margins since he came onto the political scene, but this was especially the case in 2020, when both the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>538 average</a> and our own <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>final national survey</a> had him trailing by 8 points, just as he was at this point in our polling four years ago.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">He ultimately lost the popular vote by 4 points, and that’s reasonably caused quite a few political observers to scrutinize his margin against Harris now: If Trump is once again outperforming his polling margin by roughly the same amount, then he’s actually tied with Harris right now nationwide — and he’s ahead in the swing states.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But while polling error has broken Trump’s way to date, that doesn’t mean it always will, especially if a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>heavily</a> <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>studied</a> group —&nbsp;the voters who support Trump but are too shy to say so in surveys — are now actually being captured in public sentiment. There are two big reasons to think we’re now capturing those voters better than we used to.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The first is that we and many other survey research firms are weighting surveys on recalled 2020 vote choice, so the sample reflects Trump’s level of popular-vote support from four years ago.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The second is that, as <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>our own tracking</a> and the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>broader polling averages</a> have shown, Trump has become more popular during the past year, especially as the Republican presidential primary heated up. He’s more popular than he was during the vast majority of his presidency, and he’s much more popular than he was at this time four years ago.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">All of which is to say that maybe there aren’t that many shy Trump voters anymore, portending a more accurate polling cycle.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Since polls were accurately capturing the Democratic share of support in 2020, there’s plenty of reason to believe they’re doing so now. If polls are doing a better job capturing Trump’s actual level of support this time around, we’re looking at another popular-vote margin in the region of 4 percentage points.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Whether that translates into a Harris victory in the Electoral College is a related but distinct question. I’ll have more on that in my next edition of this newsletter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6K8s7rIp55mm5%2BjwLa402arq5mToLavs4xrZ2tsXam1pnnSobBmrKKqurF51airnqqj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1604117-abachas-family-drags-tinubu-wike-court-reason-emerges.html><span>←</span><span>Abachas Family Drags Tinubu, Wike to Court, Reason Emerges</span></a>
