At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, there’s a&nbsp;bonus section about a&nbsp;character in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;your favorite Disney stories.</p><p><h2>1. Allegra Coleman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fde/be5/1351b0514286d11056c2e0ae4a.jpg><p>Writer Martha Sherill created a&nbsp;<a href=#>fictional celebrity</a> named Allegra Coleman for Esquire (November 1996) and the magazine featured Ali Larter as&nbsp;the model for the character. Good news for Ali Larter is&nbsp;that this incident actually helped jump-start her acting career as&nbsp;she nabbed roles in&nbsp;TV shows and movies such as&nbsp;Heroes and Legally Blonde.</p><p><h2>2. Betty Crocker</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fee/2f5/c8fc625124bb33fc7c19f980b1.jpg><p>Betty Crocker is&nbsp;a&nbsp;famous household brand whose face has appeared in&nbsp;advertising campaigns for food and recipes for so&nbsp;many years that it’s hard to&nbsp;believe she’s just a&nbsp;<a href=#>fictional character</a>. She has been portrayed by&nbsp;several actresses such as&nbsp;Marjorie Husted and Adelaide Hawley Cumming.</p><p><h2>3. Mavis Beacon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ce/666/f754b45f0b93186f3dddae661a.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you lived through the ’90s, you might be&nbsp;familiar with <a href=#>Mavis Beacon</a> as&nbsp;the woman who taught you how to&nbsp;type. Haitian-born Renée L’Espérance was the model for the software Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. The name is&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;Mavis Staples (one of&nbsp;the software developer’s favorite singers) and the word beacon.</p><p><h2>4. Jack Dawson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/508/f45/26753a52fd9ac3ddfa2d344bb4.jpg><p>While the story of&nbsp;the RMS Titanic, a&nbsp;British passenger liner sinking in&nbsp;the North Atlantic Ocean was a&nbsp;<a href=#>true story</a>, the young <a href=#>Jack Dawson</a> portrayed by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Leonardo DiCaprio" data-link=tag>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> was merely a&nbsp;made-up character written by&nbsp;James Cameron.</p><p><h2>5. Kaycee Nicole Swenson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b8f/05d/44a30c592f89c387efd5b0db60.jpg><p>Kaycee was one of&nbsp;the earliest internet-famous people in&nbsp;the early 2000s. Her online diary about her struggles with leukemia won the sympathy of&nbsp;many for 2&nbsp;years before her reported death in&nbsp;2001. When Kaycee’s mother, Debbie Swenson, flat-out refused gifts of&nbsp;condolences, people investigated more into Kaycee’s life. Debbie <a href=#>revealed</a> that Kaycee was a&nbsp;character she created after her cover was blown.</p><p><h2>6. Carolyn Keene</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da5/71c/6e30ac580096be9d9d2fe8ef5f.jpg><p>The Nancy Drew series consisted of&nbsp;popular mystery books written by&nbsp;Carolyn Keene. But the truth&nbsp;is, there was no&nbsp;one by&nbsp;that name. Carolyn Keene is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;pseudonym for <a href=#>authors hired</a> to&nbsp;write the Nancy Drew and The Dana Girl mystery stories by&nbsp;Stratemeyer Syndicate.</p><p><h2>7. David Manning</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4d6/b3c/6346f55de4aca3e60092e47489.jpg><p><a href=#>David Manning’s reviews</a> for movies like Hollow Man and A&nbsp;Knight’s Tale have been seen in&nbsp;countless commercials and other promotional material for Columbia Pictures. The movie critic is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;fake person created to&nbsp;give good reviews for the company.</p><p><h2>8. George P. Burdell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84e/652/a343aa50f1a31549074374de87.jpg><p>When William Edgar Smith received 2&nbsp;Georgia Tech enrolment forms by&nbsp;mistake, he&nbsp;enrolled a&nbsp;fictitious student named <a href=#>George P. Burdell</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;practical joke. He&nbsp;even signed Burdell up&nbsp;for all the same classes he&nbsp;had and took tests twice. The fake student received his degrees from Georgia Tech. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people kept the joke alive and today, Burdell is&nbsp;a&nbsp;campus icon and there’s even a&nbsp;store at&nbsp;Georgie Tech’s student center called “Burdell”.</p><p><h2>9. Spinal Tap</h2></p><p>Spinal Tap is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>fictional heavy metal band</a> created by&nbsp;3&nbsp;comedians for a&nbsp;sketch which featured a&nbsp;mock promotional video for the song, “Rock and Roll Nightmare”. This Is&nbsp;Spinal Tap, a&nbsp;mockumentary movie (fictional events shown as&nbsp;a&nbsp;documentary), was created afterward.</p><p><h2>10. Pierre Brassau</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/29f/4c4/c4c4565c03ad1ad856f47e8cba.jpg><p>Painter Pierre Brassau was a&nbsp;<a href=#>creation</a> of&nbsp;Åke “Dacke” Axelsson, a&nbsp;journalist who wanted to&nbsp;test whether critics could tell the difference between true <a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a> and the work of&nbsp;a&nbsp;chimpanzee. He&nbsp;persuaded the keeper of&nbsp;Peter, the then 4-year-old chimpanzee, to&nbsp;let the primate paint and exhibited his best works in&nbsp;a&nbsp;gallery. Only one critic observed that “only an&nbsp;ape could have done this” while most people praised the art.</p><p><h2>11. Juan Valdez</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>Colombian coffee farmer</a> in&nbsp;the advertisements for the National Federation of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Coffee data-link=tag>Coffee</a> Growers of&nbsp;Colombia is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fictional character that has been portrayed by&nbsp;3&nbsp;different actors since 1959.</p><p><h2>12. Taro Tsujimoto</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30a/3c8/2f06775d9ea214797b558c92e5.jpg><p>Frustrated with the slow drafting process via telephone, Punch Imlach, the manager of&nbsp;Buffalo Sabres (professional ice hockey team), enlisted PR&nbsp;Director Paul Wieland to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;<a href=#>fictional player</a>. The character became an&nbsp;inside joke for Sabres’ fans who would chant, “We&nbsp;Want Taro” when the games became one-sided.</p><p><h2>13. Shudu Gram</h2></p><p>Shudu, the Instagram model, gained a&nbsp;following because of&nbsp;her otherworldly beauty but little did most of&nbsp;the followers know, the model was actually a&nbsp;<a href=#>CGI creation</a> by&nbsp;a&nbsp;British photographer Cameron-James Wilson. She even did advertising work for Fenty Beauty and Soul Sky brands.</p><p><h2>14. Alan Smithee</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/13d/661/5f05a550de8d0f4b250b898fe4.jpg><p>Alan Smithee is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;real movie director, but rather, an&nbsp;<a href=#>official name</a> directors use when they do&nbsp;not want to&nbsp;credit movies under their own names. The members of&nbsp;the Directors Guild of&nbsp;America (DGA) would need to&nbsp;prove to&nbsp;the guild panel that they were not able to&nbsp;exercise creative control over the film before they could use the name.</p><p><h2>15. Lonelygirl15</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d11/fb4/5469585ba98d330a8cf0333765.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the earliest vlogs on&nbsp;Youtube, <a href=#>lonelygirl15</a>, initially posted videos under the pretense of&nbsp;an&nbsp;authentic vlog. The web series focused on&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;teen named Bree who was played by&nbsp;actress Jessica Rose.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Hua Mulan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/479/600/e0cedc59b095571a9daf3bdacb.jpg><p>The most well-known Mulan in&nbsp;the world might be&nbsp;from Disney’s depiction of&nbsp;her but the powerful story of&nbsp;the Chinese warrior has been adapted so&nbsp;many times that she is&nbsp;sometimes believed to&nbsp;have been a&nbsp;real person. <a href=#>Hua Mulan</a> was actually created by&nbsp;author Guo Maoqian in&nbsp;Ballad of&nbsp;Mulan.</p><p>Were you aware that all of&nbsp;these characters were fictitious before reading the article? Do&nbsp;you know any other famous fake figures that people thought were real?</p><p><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>’s comment on&nbsp;Kate Winslet’s body during the filming of&nbsp;“Titanic” had a&nbsp;profound impact on&nbsp;her. DiCaprio emphasized the importance of&nbsp;her natural shape, challenging the prevailing notion that success and beauty were synonymous with thinness. This conversation empowered Winslet to&nbsp;champion body positivity, a&nbsp;stance she has maintained throughout her career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecWapKito2K9prvPpZxmr5ikeqW7za1kmpukqq6tuNhmnLGho6l6eIWPam1pZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./13-beauty-secrets-that-help-kate-middleton-shine-brighter-than-the-sun-809166.html><span>←</span><span>13 Beauty Secrets That Help Kate Middleton Shine Brighter Than the Sun</span></a>
