Talent Recap Reading Time: 3 minutes AGT All-Stars may have gathered all the most talented acts in various Got Talent franchises, but that didn’t stop the judges from saying mean remarks to contestants. We compiled a number of ungenerous comments from the judges of the spin-off series. Let’s take a look back at them.

Emil, Dariel</h3><p>Emil and Dariel were a cellist duo from season nine of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a>, who came back for another shot on the national stage. Apparently though, Howie Mandel thought that the two failed to meet the standards of the show. Simon Cowell further chimed in, saying that the duo was talented yet “boring” and lacked the personality needed to become a star.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/mecQdrvaDSo</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Sethward</h3><p>Sethward’s novelty act in the first round of the spin-off series consisted of portraying himself as a goat along with his previous Got Talent costumes. The performance has received three red buzzes, all pressed by Simon Cowell. At the end of the performance, Cowell unabashedly stated that Sethward “shouldn’t even be here.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/-WsGEATZ2Us</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Voices of Hope Youth Choir</h3><p>While Voices of Hope didn’t necessarily bore or annoy the judges, their performance also didn’t seem to impress. Citing Mandel’s words, “this doesn’t for me, personally rise above a really nice school assembly.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/hlxcGCPINTg</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Brett Loudermilk</h3><p>Obviously having higher expectations than before, Cowell is not holding back when it came to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brett Loudermilk</a>’s death-defying act. According to the judge, Loudermilk’s act was like being at a “very weird children’s party.” He went on and stated that the AGT season 15 alum failed to “wow” them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Captain Ruin</h3><p>During the Preliminaries, Captain Ruin dared himself to do a knife-throwing challenge to prevent potentially getting crushed by a falling piano. Cowell, however, thought that this performance was packed with build-ups but lacked delivery. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heidi Klum</a> agreed, saying that she didn’t get “super scaredy” with the performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Keren Montero</h3><p>Keren Montero was the winner of Dominicana’s Got Talent season 2. Singing Lauren Daigle’s “Rescue” during her AGT All-Stars preliminary performance, Montero apparently failed to excite Cowell. As stated by the music mogul, she could’ve chosen a song and turned it into her “unique version.” Upon hearing his mean comment, the crowd immediately booed Cowell, with him responding that he’s only “trying to be constructive.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/ByJafdBwmBI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Lioz Shem Tov</h3><p>In an attempt to showcase his comedic act, Lioz Shem Tov’s AGT All-Stars performance consisted of mimicking other contestant’s magic and novelty acts. While Mandel did like the act, Cowell and Klum weren’t convinced. Cowell shamelessly said that his performance was “stupid,” while Klum honestly commented that she “didn’t” love it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/vXnxKh7nuTI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Dustin’s Dojo</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dustin’s Dojo</a>’s preliminary performance in AGT All-Stars comprised a comedic karate act. Not fascinated by the scene, Cowell didn’t hold himself back and told him that his act was “crappy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/VAT11aPi4FI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-peter-antoniou>9. Peter Antoniou</h3><p>Wanting to prove his mentalist skills, Peter Antoniou’s act consisted of hosting a “psychic tea party” with Terry Crews, Mandel, and an audience member. Cowell buzzed the act, commenting that it “wasn’t very good” as it took too long. He also pointed out that Antoniou’s performance showed his lack of showmanship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NUP_194863_00783.jpg alt="Ranking The Best Ariana Grande Covers on Talent Shows" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWVlrumv9Nmoa6cl5p6pLvMppynrKNivK95wKCrZpmcoXq0wMCrqmZqYGeAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-love-story-of-the-woman-who-captured-the-hearts-of-generations-while-being-married-to-mr-right-for-56-years-805852.html><span>←</span><span>The 58-Year-Old Romantic Story of Dolly Parton Who Proves Love Can Be Eternal</span></a>
