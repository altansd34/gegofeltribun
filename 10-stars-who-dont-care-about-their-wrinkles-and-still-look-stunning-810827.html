The actress said she wanted to&nbsp;age naturally and look like these women when she got older. But at&nbsp;the same time, she worries when she finds new silver hair on&nbsp;her head and wants to&nbsp;dye them as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>Keira is&nbsp;sure that she’s just scared of&nbsp;seeing a&nbsp;different person in&nbsp;the mirror. But, judging by&nbsp;her photos, she’s not planning to&nbsp;change anything about her appearance. And we&nbsp;support her decisions because she only gets more and more beautiful with age.</p><p><h2>Anne Hathaway, 40&nbsp;years old</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f1/b36/0ab565598d89f57aa6393dacc8.jpg><p>Piovanotto Marco/ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>The star of&nbsp;<i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> thinks that wrinkles make women more beautiful.</p><p>Anne once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;had someone offer me&nbsp;<a href=# title=Botox data-link=tag>Botox</a> at&nbsp;23.

If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;pictures of&nbsp;me&nbsp;from a&nbsp;young age, I’ve been smiling the same way since&nbsp;I was little. And I&nbsp;had that wonderful moment when you realize, ’That’s who&nbsp;I am.’ Botox would erase that.”</p><p><h2>Carey Mulligan, 37&nbsp;years old</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e94/7ac/42ef0e54f2b74302caba4bed2f.jpg><p>ROBYN BECK/AFP/East News</p><p>Carey had a&nbsp;similar experience.
