After that, the judges narrowed the competition down to 16 dancers for the duets portion.</p><p>After performing their choreographed duets, the first eight dancers received their critiques from judges Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Comfort Fedoke, and Allison Holker. They were then informed that all eight of them were moving on to the Top 10. That meant that only two members of the second group of eight dancers would be going through.</p><p>Those two dancers turned out to be Avery Gay and Jaylin Sanders. Ultimately, the Top 10 includes Anthony Curley, Avery Gay, Braylon Browner, Dakayla Wilson, Easton Magliarditi, Jaylin Sanders, Madison Rogue Alvarado, Mariyah Hawkins, Olivia Alboher, and Roman Nevinchanya.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE’ SEASON 18 AUDITIONS WRAP UP</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-show-shared-a-season-preview>The Show Shared a Season Preview</h2><p>At the end of Monday night’s new episode, So You Think You Can Dance shared a preview of what fans can expect to see this season.
