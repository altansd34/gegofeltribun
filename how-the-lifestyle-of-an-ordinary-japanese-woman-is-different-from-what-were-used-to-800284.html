We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side have studied the blogs of&nbsp;local women and made an&nbsp;approximate daily schedule that most Japanese women adhere&nbsp;to.
Morning
Women in&nbsp;Japan, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, get up&nbsp;just after 5&nbsp;a.m., and they do&nbsp;it&nbsp;very quietly as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;their husband and children."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Preschool children in&nbsp;this country usually <a href=#>sleep</a> in&nbsp;the same bed with their parents.</p><p>After hygiene procedures take place, Japanese women either start preparing <a href=# title=breakfast data-link=tag>breakfast</a> or&nbsp;start a&nbsp;quick load of&nbsp;<a href=#>laundry</a>. They don’t take a&nbsp;shower in&nbsp;the morning&nbsp;— it’s customary here to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that in&nbsp;the evening after a&nbsp;working day. In&nbsp;the morning, Japanese women <a href=#>just</a> comb their hair, brush their teeth, and <a href=# title=wash data-link=tag>wash</a> their faces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ef/3ac/712c3751adb9f705261c6c46a9.jpg><p>If&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the family is&nbsp;already awake, Japanese women will make the bed. But they do&nbsp;this <a href=#>in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different way</a> than we&nbsp;do. Many people don’t have bedspreads, so&nbsp;they just need to&nbsp;spread the sheet flat and fold the duvet and pillows neatly so&nbsp;that there’s no&nbsp;visible clutter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91f/dd8/1492935ebb9688615f7886cd0d.jpg><p>Breakfast for a&nbsp;Japanese family is&nbsp;also different from what we’re used to&nbsp;in&nbsp;other countries. They aren’t content with quick sandwiches or&nbsp;scrambled eggs. Instead, they <a href=#>prepare</a> a&nbsp;full-fledged meal&nbsp;— they stew vegetables, fry meat, and cook rice.</p><p>In&nbsp;the morning, they need to&nbsp;prepare breakfast for their child for school. Of&nbsp;course, some mothers are satisfied with their child eating breakfast in&nbsp;the school cafeteria, but this is&nbsp;generally considered <a href=#>indecent</a>. A&nbsp;mother in&nbsp;the local community is&nbsp;judged by&nbsp;what kind of&nbsp;breakfast her child carries to&nbsp;school. If&nbsp;the lunchbox is&nbsp;sloppy or&nbsp;if&nbsp;a&nbsp;child doesn’t have breakfast at&nbsp;all, the mother is&nbsp;considered bad, and the same goes vice versa. And it’s not enough just to&nbsp;put food in&nbsp;the lunchbox. You need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;beautifully, making some figurines from it&nbsp;— so&nbsp;in&nbsp;general, you have to&nbsp;show some kind of&nbsp;creativity.</p><p>The husband gets <a href=#>woken up</a>&nbsp;so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;has just enough time to&nbsp;have breakfast and immediately go&nbsp;to&nbsp;work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/589/6b4/d0c7ed5b28b478c7fa141793d3.jpg><p>The way Japanese women wash dishes, is&nbsp;again, not at&nbsp;all similar to&nbsp;the way <a href=#>we&nbsp;do&nbsp;it</a>. The water isn’t left on&nbsp;for a&nbsp;long time&nbsp;— they simply soap up&nbsp;all the plates and cookware and then put them in&nbsp;the sink while the water is&nbsp;turned off. Then they rinse everything together.</p><p>It’s interesting that some Japanese women <a href=#>don’t use</a> dishwashing detergent to&nbsp;protect their hands. Instead, they put special soap in&nbsp;the sink. This saves them time because they don’t need to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bottle and squeeze the product out every time they need some soap&nbsp;— they just rub the sponge on&nbsp;the soap and it&nbsp;foams.</p><p>After breakfast, the child <a href=#>brushes</a> their teeth a&nbsp;second time, then they get dressed and are taken to&nbsp;school or&nbsp;kindergarten. <a href=#>Many</a> women in&nbsp;Japan have mothers’ bicycles with baskets and <a href=#>special</a> child seats.</p><p>Schools and kindergartens in&nbsp;this country are open from 6&nbsp;a.m. to&nbsp;8&nbsp;p.m. so&nbsp;that it’s convenient for working parents to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;their children. Of&nbsp;course, children don’t study during this entire period&nbsp;— <a href=#>there are</a> game breaks.</p><p>After a&nbsp;Japanese mother takes their child to&nbsp;school, she <a href=#>returns home</a> and has breakfast herself. And then she goes to&nbsp;work if&nbsp;she’s not a&nbsp;housewife.</p><p><h2>Daytime</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/176/517/d62f7e5797b0390408297f586e.jpg><p>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman doesn’t work and her child hasn’t reached school age, she spends the whole day with them. In&nbsp;fact, such mothers <a href=#>aren’t able</a> to&nbsp;send a&nbsp;baby to&nbsp;kindergarten because child care facilities are available for working parents only.</p><p>During the day, housewives <a href=#>do</a>&nbsp;the cleaning, cooking, and washing, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;shopping. And they go&nbsp;for walks with their children, of&nbsp;course. They do&nbsp;this mainly in&nbsp;parks. There’s even a&nbsp;special <a href=#>term</a> for these women in&nbsp;Japan known as&nbsp;“park mothers.”</p><p>Society in&nbsp;such parks has a&nbsp;strict hierarchy. Each mother has her own “title,” and getting into a&nbsp;local clique of&nbsp;mothers isn’t so&nbsp;easy&nbsp;— only leaders can decide whether to&nbsp;accept new women into their “club.”</p><p>In&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;working women, they postpone all household chores until the evening. After the mother picks up&nbsp;her child from kindergarten or&nbsp;school, she <a href=#>goes</a> with them to&nbsp;the grocery store and then returns home.</p><p><h2>Evening</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f7/3c5/8342175ed49443579d368fd35b.jpg><p>The first thing a&nbsp;woman has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;laundry if&nbsp;she didn’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the morning as&nbsp;it’s <a href=#>impolite</a> in&nbsp;Japan to&nbsp;start this process after 7&nbsp;p.m. Many people go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed around this time and they may complain about the noise.</p><p>Japanese women do&nbsp;laundry every day. For one, this is&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the fact that children quickly get their clothes dirty, and secondly, because of&nbsp;their amazing cleanliness. For example, locals <a href=#>change</a> the towels in&nbsp;their bathrooms daily.</p><p>After cleaning and doing laundry, women <a href=#>take a&nbsp;bath</a> themselves and then bathe the children. Then they cook dinner. Interestingly, in&nbsp;some residential buildings, water is&nbsp;highly chlorinated so&nbsp;it&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;drunk or&nbsp;used for cooking. People <a href=#>have to</a>&nbsp;buy mineral water for these purposes.</p><p>Before going to&nbsp;bed, women prepare rice for breakfast. They <a href=#>put it</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special device&nbsp;— a&nbsp;rice cooker. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;timer function so&nbsp;that the rice will start cooking at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain time and won’t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cooked in&nbsp;the morning.</p><p>The child is&nbsp;put to&nbsp;bed first, and the woman can devote all the time remaining in&nbsp;the night to&nbsp;herself.</p><p>Did you like the schedule these Japanese women follow? How different is&nbsp;it&nbsp;from what you’re used&nbsp;to?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ytn55lnJ6zpr%2FTsqOeZZ%2BbeqK6jKipnaGelr%2B6ecmap5qmlaiybsPOppinZZmoeqW1xZ%2Bcq52eqXqnvs6mZLCgkal6uLHRnmSuq5WZerW7jHFnaWpoaXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-ryan-kwanten-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Ryan Kwanten Make?
