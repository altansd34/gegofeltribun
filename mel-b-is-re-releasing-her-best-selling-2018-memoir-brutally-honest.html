The AGT: Fantasy League host recently announced that she’s rereleasing her 2018 memoir Brutally Honest with three more brand-new chapters.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mel-b-to-release-updated-version-of-her-memoir-brutally-honest>Mel B to Release Updated Version of Her Memoir Brutally Honest</h2><p>The former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spice Girl</a> announced the great news on Instagram through a video of herself showcasing the paperback. In the clip, Mel was wearing a cheetah-print fitted long sleeves layered by a black bodysuit.</p><p>“I am soooo sooooo excited to tell you ALL this….my book “Brutally Honest”is coming out this March in paperback whoop whoop WITH ‘3 brand new chapters’ bringing you up to date on my rollercoaster life,” she wrote.</p><p>According to the singer, the book narrates how she dealt with the good and “very bad” times of her life. She also talked about Spice Girls tour and touched some topics regarding her family and friends. The book especially highlights how she “regained my confidence” and “inner girl power.”</p><p>The memoir, aside from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT: Fantasy League</a>, is one of the several projects Mel was looking forward to in 2024. In her previous interview with Glamour, she said Brutally Honest gives an “unfiltered look into her 10-year abusive relationship with ex-husband Stephen Belafonte.”</p><p>“Nobody really knew the kind of life that I was dealing with when I would go home having worked all day on set for 10 hours or so on&nbsp;America’s Got Talent,” she said. “So it’s nice to be honest and truthful and help people realize that that’s the kind of thing that shouldn’t be happening to you. You can rid the shame and rid the guilt and do something about it and get yourself to a safe place.”</p><p>Mel has been vocal about her dedication to raising awareness on domestic violence. As an advocate, the singer has obtained coveted honors from the royal family for her philanthropy.</p><p>Brutally Honest paperback edition is out on the March 5 in the US and March 7 in the U.K. For now, fans are allowed to pre-order the book online.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-teased-possible-spice-girls-reunion>She Teased Possible Spice Girls Reunion</h2><p>Mel is also gearing up for a possible <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spice Girls reunion</a>. During her latest interview with Today with Hoda & Jenna, she said that they’ve been brewing something for their fans as a group.</p><p>“Well, I’ve been saying this forever, but now we’re actually going to be releasing some really good news in about a few weeks that involves all five of us,” she said.</p><p>While it’s still not clear what kind of creative collaboration they were doing, Mel said having a reunion isn’t easy given they have “five different diaries.” Such was magnified by the fact that all Spice Girls members are mothers. Despite so, Mel said the exciting things are really coming for the iconic girl group.</p><p>“It’s going to be the gift that keeps on giving, without saying too much about it,” Mel said. “I’m going to get myself into so much trouble.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_SofiaVergaraLS2_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="Sofia Vergara Surprises Fans as She Reveals She’s a Natural Blonde" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>AGT Fantasy League</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Mel B</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6jZppdnsBuvsRmqZ6klZbAqrrGZp%2Beql2XsrTAjKycpaSZo7Rufo9qb2allaK8qr6Mm6murJGhubp5x6ilnqukZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-caly-bevier-the-cancer-survivor-who-got-simon-cowells-golden-buzzer.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Caly Bevier, The Cancer Survivor Who Got Simon Cowells Golden Buzzer</span></a>
