Berniece and her brother Robert were taken by&nbsp;their father to&nbsp;Kentucky, far from their mother.

The letter revealed a&nbsp;life-altering secret:<strong> Berniece had a&nbsp;12-year-old sister, Norma Jeane</strong>, who would one day become the iconic Marilyn Monroe. This revelation ignited a&nbsp;desire in&nbsp;both sisters to&nbsp;meet, to&nbsp;know each other.</p><p></p><p>In&nbsp;1944,<strong> the momentous </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>meeting</strong></a><strong> finally happened</strong>. Norma Jeane, not yet known as&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe, traveled to&nbsp;Detroit to&nbsp;meet Berniece and her husband, Paris. They were initially nervous about recognizing each other, but as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;they met, there was no&nbsp;mistaking the connection. Both sisters were <strong>struck by&nbsp;their physical resemblance </strong>and the immediate bond that formed.</p><p>“There was no&nbsp;chance of&nbsp;missing her. None of&nbsp;the passengers looked anything like [her]: tall, so&nbsp;pretty and fresh, and wearing what she had described, a&nbsp;cobalt wool suit and a&nbsp;hat with a&nbsp;heart shape dip in&nbsp;the brim.”</p><p><h2>The bond between the two sisters was unbreakable.</h2></p><p>Despite Marilyn’s rise to&nbsp;stardom as&nbsp;she adopted her stage name in&nbsp;1946, the sisters remained close. They confided in&nbsp;each other during challenging times, <strong>with Berniece even visiting Marilyn in&nbsp;New York during her surgery</strong>. Their sisterly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bond</a> was unbreakable.</p><p>Even when Marilyn Monroe’s marriage with Arthur Miller faced difficulties, she reached out to&nbsp;her half-sister for a&nbsp;heart-to-heart conversation.</p><p><h2>Berniece loses her sister.</h2></p><p>Tragically, Marilyn Monroe <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passed</a> away on&nbsp;August&nbsp;4, 1962, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;36. Berniece played a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;arranging her sister’s funeral. While Marilyn’s death was officially ruled as&nbsp;suicide, Berniece believed it&nbsp;could have been an&nbsp;accident, as&nbsp;she had recently spoken to&nbsp;her and knew of&nbsp;her future plans. <strong>Monroe left Miracle $10,000 in&nbsp;her final </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>will</strong></a>.</p><p>Berniece and her daughter, Mona Rae, decided to&nbsp;tell Marilyn’s story themselves, resulting in&nbsp;the touching 1994&nbsp;memoir, “My&nbsp;Sister Marilyn: A&nbsp;Memoir of&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe.” Despite many others seeking to&nbsp;tell Marilyn’s story, Berniece wanted to&nbsp;ensure her sister’s legacy was depicted truthfully and with <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>.</p><p>Berniece passed away in&nbsp;2014, 52&nbsp;years after her half-sister.</p><p>To&nbsp;many, Marilyn <a href=#>Monroe</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;enduring icon. However, to&nbsp;Berniece Baker Miracle, she was simply a&nbsp;beloved sister who left this world too soon. The remarkable story of&nbsp;these two sisters reminds&nbsp;us of&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;family bonds and love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqivsilsKdlnaS7s7vEZp%2BanF2Weq27zaBkpaejqXq0tdKtnKtlkaOxbrTEq5ysZaedrrV5wJyrrpmcocZutMCpp56mlZl6o7HTsJyepl2ptaa5jHFobm5nanw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1534997-les-10-chanteuses-les-connues-populaires-de-tous-les-temps.html><span>←</span><span>Les 10 chanteuses les plus connues et populaires de tous les temps</span></a>
