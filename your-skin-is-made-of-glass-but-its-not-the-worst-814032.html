Silhouettes of&nbsp;people seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;flashing around. Your eyes get used to&nbsp;the light, and you look around. You’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>. Doctors in&nbsp;white protective suits and gas masks are standing around you. “How do&nbsp;you feel?” one of&nbsp;them asks.</p><p>You don’t remember what happened. You scratch your head and hear a&nbsp;strange scraping sound. You look at&nbsp;your palm. It’s made of&nbsp;glass. Your whole body is&nbsp;covered with glass! The doctors say there was an&nbsp;accident, but you don’t remember anything. You get out of&nbsp;bed and notice the whole floor is&nbsp;covered with a&nbsp;thick layer of&nbsp;fluff.</p><p>This is&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;save you from breaking your skin against the hard floor. It’s difficult for you to&nbsp;move around; you feel fragile. Any contact with objects leaves scratches on&nbsp;your body, and they burn. Doctors offer you some mashed potatoes, but you aren’t hungry. You wanna know what’s going on&nbsp;and why all the people here are wearing gas masks?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/355/58a/74adf8529bb39386864f7b884e.png><p>They say you accidentally got to&nbsp;the landfill where scientists were carrying out tests with sand, fire, and radiation. For some reason, you managed to&nbsp;enter the testing ground, and your body has changed. Everyone in&nbsp;the building is&nbsp;wearing gas masks and protective suits since any kind of&nbsp;contact with you can be&nbsp;dangerous.<strong> </strong>Now you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special institution.</p><p>Scientists and doctors from all over the world are going to&nbsp;study you. You just want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;home, and see your parents and <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a>. The doctor says it’s impossible now. You need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;examined so&nbsp;that they can figure out the potential of&nbsp;your abilities. “Everything will be&nbsp;fine,” he&nbsp;adds, but his voice sounds strange.</p><p>They find out how this glass is&nbsp;interconnected with your body cells. For example, a&nbsp;mug falls on&nbsp;your foot. Now your skin there is&nbsp;cracked. But after a&nbsp;few hours, the crack disappears, and your foot becomes smooth again. Your organs, bones, and soft tissues are normal. Only the skin has acquired the properties of&nbsp;glass.</p><p>You can also make your glass skin transparent at&nbsp;will. It&nbsp;allows you to&nbsp;see your muscles. Now THAT looks scary. You’re under constant medical supervision. Almost no&nbsp;one talks to&nbsp;you or&nbsp;shows their faces. You’re nervous because there are no&nbsp;windows anywhere. The <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a> are artificial, and every night, your room gets locked with a&nbsp;magnetic lock.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b77/21c/6dcee6516ebd9830da8521a0a0.png><p>You move very carefully, afraid of&nbsp;breaking off a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;your skin. The scientists promise they’re going to&nbsp;solve this problem. They put you on&nbsp;a&nbsp;stretcher, tie you&nbsp;up, and take you somewhere. The doctor claims he&nbsp;knows how to&nbsp;make you less fragile. But you have to&nbsp;trust him.</p><p>They bring you to&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark room. The doctor asks you to&nbsp;keep your eyes closed throughout the operation. You look around and see huge stoves. People in&nbsp;gas masks are going to&nbsp;shove you there. You ask them not to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. You don’t mind remaining brittle.</p><p>The scientists put you in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cast-iron chamber. You’re screaming. There are flames around you. You close your eyes. It’s getting hotter and hotter. The fire envelops you completely. It’s like you’re inside a&nbsp;<a href=# title=volcano data-link=tag>volcano</a>, but you don’t feel any <a href=# title=pain data-link=tag>pain</a>.</p><p>After a&nbsp;few minutes, the flames disappear. Cold air starts blowing on&nbsp;your body from the walls. The researchers pull you out of&nbsp;the oven. You ask the doctor to&nbsp;untie you. “You can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;yourself,” he&nbsp;says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/623/35a/8ac38857098a7a41d35da970ae.png><p>You strain your muscles and easily tear the straps. You stand on&nbsp;the floor and feel incredible strength in&nbsp;your body. The doctor says that now, you’re made of&nbsp;tempered glass. It&nbsp;means you’re stronger than concrete and some metals.</p><p>During the entire day, you’re testing your renewed skin. You can easily break down walls and withstand any damage. Fire, arrows, hammers&nbsp;— nothing can crack your skin. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, the doctors follow you to&nbsp;your room. At&nbsp;this moment, the alarm goes off.</p><p>They forget to&nbsp;close the door and run away to&nbsp;the source of&nbsp;the commotion. You get out of&nbsp;bed and walk into the hallway. The whole building is&nbsp;flashing with red lights. Loud sirens are blaring all over the place. The elevator doors open, and several people in&nbsp;gas masks run out. You get to&nbsp;the nearest <a href=# title=office data-link=tag>office</a> and hide there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c20/195/dd126954feb9e960ada366a11b.png><p>They run past. You’re looking around the room. It&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;laboratory. There are ampoules, instruments, and other scientific stuff everywhere. There are also countless X-ray pictures on&nbsp;the walls. You find a&nbsp;small flashlight and put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;your pocket. Then, you notice some documents on&nbsp;the table. On&nbsp;the first page, you see your photo. You look through the file but can’t read anything. Instead of&nbsp;letters, there are strange symbols on&nbsp;the page. It&nbsp;looks like some unknown language.</p><p>Someone grabs you from behind. It’s a&nbsp;young girl. She’s crying and asking for help! Her tears are dripping on&nbsp;your hands. Scientists come into the office and lead the girl away. “Run away from here!” she screams before disappearing behind the corner. You look at&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the doctors. “What is&nbsp;this place?” you ask. “Please, go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;your room,” the doctor replies politely. You leave the office and notice a&nbsp;strange smell.</p><p>It’s your hands. They smell like gasoline. It&nbsp;must be&nbsp;the tears of&nbsp;that girl! Was she crying... fuel? You go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed and decide that tomorrow, you’ll escape from this terrible place. You’re nervous, and at&nbsp;this moment, something happens to&nbsp;your body. You look at&nbsp;your hand and see your reflection.</p><p>Your skin has turned into a&nbsp;mirror. Great! Another superpower. You reach into your pocket to&nbsp;pull out the flashlight and find a&nbsp;card to&nbsp;the magnetic lock! That girl must have put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;your pocket. She probably stole it&nbsp;from the doctors. Now you just have to&nbsp;find and save her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f78/de0/bc832d56b2a53c4c748a804146.png><p>You work out on&nbsp;a&nbsp;treadmill and ask to&nbsp;visit the bathroom. The doctors are waiting for you behind the door. You wash your hands and look at&nbsp;yourself in&nbsp;the mirror. You have an&nbsp;idea. You switch on&nbsp;your “mirror” abilities, stand next to&nbsp;the sink, and merge with the bathroom mirror. You’re waiting.</p><p>The doctors, still in&nbsp;their gas masks, burst into the room. They don’t notice you. After saying something in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown language, they leave. Suddenly, one of&nbsp;them returns. He&nbsp;looks at&nbsp;his reflection in&nbsp;the mirror&nbsp;— right into your face. Luckily, he&nbsp;doesn’t notice you. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;moment, he&nbsp;goes away.</p><p>After a&nbsp;while, you also get out and run down the corridor. You hear voices behind you. You turn your skin into a&nbsp;mirror again and hide around the corner. A&nbsp;group of&nbsp;scientists runs past. Now, you’re heading the other way. You run through a&nbsp;long corridor but see a&nbsp;dead end. Without hesitation, you punch through the wall and find yourself in&nbsp;the main hall.</p><p>There are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;closed rooms with people here. Someone covered in&nbsp;flames is&nbsp;walking inside a&nbsp;fireproof room. You see a&nbsp;guy behind another door. Instead of&nbsp;hair, he&nbsp;has plants growing on&nbsp;his head. There are people with weird superpowers everywhere. You use the magnetic card to&nbsp;open all the doors. But no&nbsp;one leaves their cells.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c50/8d5/64528b5024baed3956dc9a40d3.png><p>“Why did you do&nbsp;it? You don’t know yet?” asks an&nbsp;old lady with lanterns instead of&nbsp;eyes. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the cells, you find the girl who gave you the magnetic card. You ask her to&nbsp;run away with you, but she just looks at&nbsp;you and shakes her head&nbsp;no. At&nbsp;this moment, the alarm goes off again.</p><p>The doors are closing. You run out of&nbsp;the hall and find yourself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;long dark corridor. You close the door and break the lock. It’s dark here. You turn the flashlight on&nbsp;and direct the beam at&nbsp;your body. It&nbsp;reflects and illuminates the entire corridor like a&nbsp;powerful night lamp. You walk further and notice another light source.</p><p>It’s a&nbsp;window! Finally! You run as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;possible. You’re approaching the small window leading to&nbsp;freedom. Your pursuers break out the door and scream something to&nbsp;you. You can’t hear them. You only think about escape. The window is&nbsp;getting closer. The light of&nbsp;the outside world becomes brighter.</p><p>You clench your fist to&nbsp;break the glass. There are still a&nbsp;few steps left, and... you stop. Your eyes fill with horror, your whole body begins to&nbsp;tremble. What you see outside the window can’t fit in&nbsp;your head in&nbsp;any way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f40/90b/5e40635d11aff43aed65ea1e82.png><p>You’re looking at&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge asteroid belt, the lights of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown purple planet, the bright searchlights of&nbsp;the space station. You realize that you are not on&nbsp;Earth. You’re inside a&nbsp;huge spaceship, very far from home. You may be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the galaxy.</p><p>These beings, whatever they are, have taken you from Earth to&nbsp;conduct experiments on&nbsp;you. You’re so&nbsp;shocked that you lose consciousness. Darkness. You’re finally coming to&nbsp;your senses.</p><p>You see several people in&nbsp;white protective suits. You don’t know where you are and don’t remember anything. “How do&nbsp;you feel?” the doctor asks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2db/51f/af41c659208abc47d18c7baa01.png><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMawwdFmqqShnmK2tHnMmpueZZ%2Bbeqi4wKyqZpqlqXqqwNJmpaisXam1pnnWqKmsrF1tfnV8kmtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./surveys.html><span>←</span><span>YouGov | What the world thinks</span></a>
