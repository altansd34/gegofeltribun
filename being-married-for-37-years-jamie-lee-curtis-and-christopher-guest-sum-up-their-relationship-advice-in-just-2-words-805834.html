We&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;share this story so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;can all see that when it’s the right person, all the work a&nbsp;relationship takes is&nbsp;worth it&nbsp;for love and security.</p><p><h2>Jamie Lee Curtis knew immediately that he&nbsp;was the one.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ad/11e/deb80c572f8a5e98ab719b4569.jpg><p>Jamie first “met” Christopher when she was 25&nbsp;years old when she saw his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>picture</a> in&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine. She immediately told her friend that she would marry him. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange coincidence, her friend happened to&nbsp;know his agent, and told Jamie this. She called and gave them her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>number</a> in&nbsp;case Chris was interested, but he&nbsp;never called.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be8/98f/2f8ba65a349c885b28e9f9c382.jpg><p>Jamie says now that her whole life <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hinged</a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;seconds that she didn’t see coming&nbsp;— seeing his picture in&nbsp;that magazine. Showing you truly never know what is&nbsp;around the corner or&nbsp;what chance might bring you.</p><p><h2>Their real-life meeting was pure serendipity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/897/936/0f7ab25deb97551f9f74a59fe4.jpg><p>Jamie went on&nbsp;with her life. She even began dating someone else, but it&nbsp;wasn’t serious. She had just said goodbye to&nbsp;him, when she was at&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>restaurant</a> having dinner with friends. Suddenly, she looked up&nbsp;and saw Christopher 3&nbsp;tables away. They waved at&nbsp;each other&nbsp;— he&nbsp;must have known who she was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7f/308/ca67ea5a3e9ea7b68e5ac6befc.jpg><p>The next day he&nbsp;called her and they went on&nbsp;their first date. After a&nbsp;month, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;fly to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>New York</a> to&nbsp;film <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. But they were already in&nbsp;love.</p><p><h2>They got married pretty quickly.</h2></p><p>They were talking on&nbsp;the phone while Christopher was in&nbsp;New York, when he&nbsp;asked her: “Do&nbsp;you like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diamonds</a>?” Just 4&nbsp;months after they started dating, they got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> in&nbsp;December of&nbsp;1984&nbsp;at a&nbsp;friend’s house. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;quick, low-key ceremony: they were even home by&nbsp;7:30&nbsp;pm!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bda/74b/13aa9f5be19082c41367d23208.png><p>They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adopted</a> their daughter, Annie, soon after she was born in&nbsp;1986. They chose to&nbsp;adopt because they struggled with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>infertility</a>, but their adoption process was pretty magical. They actually met Annie’s birth mother and when they met her, they knew they could adopt. Having a&nbsp;child really helped her and Christopher feel like a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>family</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b0/df3/1fa7b45205b154237ff8d88c8c.jpg><p>The adoption of&nbsp;their second child was what Jamie called “celestial.” She would have said no&nbsp;to&nbsp;another child because Annie was 9&nbsp;years old... but some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>serendipitous circumstances</a> occurred, involving a&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;theirs who had passed away, and they had their second child within 4&nbsp;days in&nbsp;1996. Jamie actually witnessed the birth. Their second child, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ruby</a>, came out as&nbsp;transgender in&nbsp;2021 and Jamie has been very supportive.</p><p><h2>They recognize each other’s similarities.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c2/396/c746b952b5abecac70712a0436.jpg><p>Jamie’s famous parents had a&nbsp;messy divorce in&nbsp;1962, when she was only 3&nbsp;years old. When she first met Christopher she didn’t smile a&nbsp;lot as&nbsp;she was self-conscious about her “dull-looking” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>teeth</a>, which is&nbsp;why she never smiled and developed her famous smirk. Then, on&nbsp;seeing Christopher’s smirk in&nbsp;his picture, she immediately saw him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kindred spirit. Jamie says she “thought we’d understand each other” when she saw his photograph. “Hidden in&nbsp;that smirk, I&nbsp;think, was a&nbsp;little<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> secret </a>that only I&nbsp;knew.” And they are also both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>funny&nbsp;—</a> she gets his sense of&nbsp;humor.</p><p><h2>They are grateful for the safety of&nbsp;marriage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/35d/5d3/36404951f8b901c170428f7a8c.jpg><p>For their 35th anniversary, Jamie wrote her husband a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>song</a> including the lyrics: “I&nbsp;feel safe when&nbsp;I drive up&nbsp;and see that you are home.” Though the thrill and hope of&nbsp;early marriage are exciting, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the reality and unknown of&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-term marriage, and of&nbsp;life, that is&nbsp;truly magical, including going through life knowing you’re not alone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e1f/8b4/5614e75ead84afb2fde1c66a2e.png><p>They spend quality time together, like Christopher will <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>play</a> in&nbsp;the kitchen while Jamie cooks and their daughter, Ruby, dances. They appreciate the little things like spending quality time together.</p><p><h2>She’s a&nbsp;romantic, but also a&nbsp;realist.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed0/cf5/9219665542a559d076f9b7dd8e.jpg><p>Jamie is&nbsp;a&nbsp;realist, but she calls herself a&nbsp;“deep, serious <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>romantic</a>” and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;her “one and only.” She does have a&nbsp;pragmatic view of&nbsp;marriage and she appreciates the security and safety that it&nbsp;gives her more than any big, romantic gesture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4da/abe/f100305254845b39774f444cde.jpg><p>And she has 2&nbsp;simple words of&nbsp;advice for sustaining a&nbsp;long marriage: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>“Don’t leave.”</a> She refers to&nbsp;the recovery phrase “Stay on&nbsp;the bus...the scenery will change” as&nbsp;a&nbsp;metaphor for marriage too. Any unhappy moment will pass, so&nbsp;stay on&nbsp;the ride. She respects Christopher and she just hasn’t left.</p><p>What long-standing Hollywood couples do&nbsp;you admire?
