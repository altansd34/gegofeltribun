Senior management is entitled to further remuneration. In most cases, a standard period of 15 days applies, originating from the applicable collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The notice of termination period obligation for employees on shorter contracts should be explicitly outlined in the employment contract, especially if extended beyond 15 days.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the consequences of an insufficient notice period?</h3><p>In cases when a Spanish employer gives less than 15 days notice of termination, the employee is entitled to 6 paid hours per week. This time is considered a buffer period to look for new employment.</p><p>If the employee fails to give sufficient notice for terminating employment, employers in Spain can claim compensation for harm or loss.
