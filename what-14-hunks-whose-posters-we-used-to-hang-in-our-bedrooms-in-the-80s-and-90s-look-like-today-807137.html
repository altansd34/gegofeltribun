It’s the screen that offers&nbsp;us to&nbsp;look back at&nbsp;great actors and leading men that marked an&nbsp;entire era, but it&nbsp;also shows them today with the changes that time and the years have made to&nbsp;their appearance.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;travel back in&nbsp;time and remember what the leading men of&nbsp;the ’80s and ’90s looked like back then to&nbsp;see how they’ve changed.</p><p><h2>1. John Travolta</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2bc/6dd/651858573290fe2fb5f1fd6028.jpg><p>Multifaceted as&nbsp;they come, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>John Travolta</a> has conquered generations both through his performances on&nbsp;the big screen and through his dances, productions, and even songs. After leaving millions of&nbsp;viewers open-mouthed with his role in&nbsp;the movie, <i>Grease</i>, he&nbsp;gained fame in&nbsp;the ’80s when watched him in&nbsp;productions like <i>Blow Out</i> and dancing again in&nbsp;<i>Staying Alive</i>. Travolta is&nbsp;still very present on&nbsp;the big screen today with performances in&nbsp;films like <i>Trading Paint</i> and <i>The Fanatic</i>.</p><p><h2>2. Richard Gere</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c6/03b/4a97a15587b687c31718450748.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Richard Gere</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor who’s had an&nbsp;impressive career on&nbsp;the big screen. Although his film appearances began in&nbsp;the ’70s, it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the ’80s when he&nbsp;really rose to&nbsp;fame for his character in&nbsp;the film, <i>American Gigolo</i>. The success he&nbsp;reaped from that film was just a&nbsp;taste of&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;achievements he&nbsp;would continue to&nbsp;collect over the years. In&nbsp;the ’90s, he&nbsp;left no&nbsp;one indifferent with the well-known film, <i>Pretty Woman</i>,<i> </i>and more recently, <i>The Dinner.</i></p><p><h2>3. Christopher Lambert</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61e/271/5aaf0d5c31a5fe06eeaa2f0f3c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 1980s, movie theaters played several films by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Christopher Lambert</a>, an&nbsp;actor of&nbsp;French origin who came to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;name for himself in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> blockbusters.<i> Greystoke, The Legend of&nbsp;Tarzan, Lord of&nbsp;the Apes</i>,<i> </i>and<i> Highlander </i>are some of&nbsp;his best-remembered roles from that era, but later came other blockbusters, such as<i>&nbsp;Resurrection </i>and<i> Ghost Rider.</i></p><p><h2>4. Kurt Russell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e2/7b9/30d6d0511293b2cb0e31c0fcd3.jpg><p>The son of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dancer and an&nbsp;actor, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kurt Rusell</a> began his career in&nbsp;the film world in&nbsp;the 1960s and went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;become one of&nbsp;the most recognizable faces of&nbsp;action movies. In&nbsp;the 1980s, he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;popular feature films, like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Big Trouble in&nbsp;Little China</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Tango &&nbsp;Cash</i></a>, while in&nbsp;the 1990s, we&nbsp;saw him in&nbsp;<i>Stargate </i>and, more recently,<i> Once Upon a&nbsp;Time in&nbsp;Hollywood, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Christmas Chronicles</i></a>,<i> </i>and<i> Fast and Furious&nbsp;9.</i></p><p><h2>5. Rob Lowe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7aa/b79/0fa7fb56d1ae5b414c2a250dc7.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rob Lowe</a>’s beginnings were in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>modeling</a>, but his interest in&nbsp;acting grew when he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;several plays. In&nbsp;the ’80s, he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;movies, but perhaps the film that made him world-famous was <i>The Outsiders</i>, together with other popular actors, like Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon, and Ralph Macchio. More recently, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;other productions, such as&nbsp;<i>Super Troopers 2</i>&nbsp;and <i>How to&nbsp;Be a&nbsp;Latin Lover</i>.</p><p><h2>6. Tom Selleck</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de8/ec6/61cef25c0bbc59b2c234cd63ed.jpg><p>He&nbsp;started his acting career in&nbsp;the late ’60s and early ’70s. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Selleck</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who always stands out for his elegance&nbsp;— and his classic mustache, of&nbsp;course. His most popular role was the private investigator protagonist of&nbsp;the ’80s series,<i> Magnum, P.I.</i>, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;his character in&nbsp;<i>Three Men and a&nbsp;Baby</i>. He’s still active today, and you can see him in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series, <i>Blue Bloods</i>.</p><p><h2>7. Harrison Ford</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31f/8fd/849c6158a79db4d66b1a0687c2.jpg><p>His path to&nbsp;success and worldwide popularity arrived only in&nbsp;the late ’70s and early ’80s, even though he&nbsp;had already been acting for a&nbsp;while. It&nbsp;was the renowned creative director George Lucas who gave him the opportunity to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;his most beloved and remembered films to&nbsp;this day, like <i>Star Wars</i>. Thus, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Harrison Ford</a> became Han Solo, and soon after that,<i> Indiana Jones</i>. And the rest is&nbsp;Hollywood history.</p><p><h2>8. Michael Douglas</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f38/56a/0d8fd35a4a84876b5d3b94eb63.jpg><p>Son of&nbsp;famed actor Kirk Douglas, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Michael Douglas</a> followed in&nbsp;his talented father’s footsteps to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;renowned actor. With appearances in&nbsp;important ’80s and ’90s productions, such as&nbsp;<i>Basic Instinct</i>, he&nbsp;made it&nbsp;clear he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;gift for acting. Perhaps that’s why, even today, at&nbsp;77, he&nbsp;still appears in&nbsp;major films, like <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;in&nbsp;TV series, such as&nbsp;<i>The Kominsky Method</i>.</p><p><h2>9. Matt Dillon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65c/ddd/95d33c5ecf87bb9763604d7d2b.jpg><p>Another beloved leading man of&nbsp;the ’80s and ’90s is&nbsp;the actor and film and television producer, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Matt Dillon</a>. His roles in&nbsp;films like <i>The Outsiders</i>, <i>To&nbsp;Die For</i>, and <i>There’s Something About Mary</i> were instrumental in&nbsp;making his work critically and popularly acclaimed to&nbsp;this day.</p><p><h2>10. Matthew Broderick</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/582/76f/d8eb745e7aa748fc4227483619.jpg><p>He&nbsp;inherited his passion for art and acting from his parents and, almost inevitably, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Matthew Broderick</a> ended up&nbsp;being a&nbsp;sought-after performer. <i>Godzilla</i> and <i>Inspector Gadget</i> are some of&nbsp;the films in&nbsp;which we&nbsp;could see him back in&nbsp;the ’90s, and more recently, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;flicks like <i>Lazy Susan</i>.</p><p><h2>11. Devon Sawa</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91b/665/1abcef538492300b2bd96fc9ff.jpg><p>He&nbsp;rose to&nbsp;fame in&nbsp;1995 when he&nbsp;played the human form of&nbsp;the endearing little ghost known as&nbsp;<i>Casper</i>. In&nbsp;2000, further success followed, and his career continued with <i>Final Destination</i>. In&nbsp;2022, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Devon Sawa</a> shared the stage with stars like Bruce Willis and Luke Wilson in&nbsp;the movie, <i>Gasoline Alley</i>.</p><p><h2>12. John Cusack</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e0/137/b0386a5341a8c28d6f6a4ec0aa.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>John Cusack</a> is&nbsp;another name from that era that everybody still knows today. With films of&nbsp;the caliber of&nbsp;<i>Being John Malkovich</i>, Cusack managed to&nbsp;reach millions of&nbsp;people and a&nbsp;well-deserved place among the stars of&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p><h2>13. James Spader</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41e/3c7/da804b57b5a2846db83c642a32.jpg><p>This actor may currently be&nbsp;best known for his role as&nbsp;Raymond Reddington in&nbsp;the popular&nbsp;TV series, <i>The Blacklist</i>. However, his acting career is&nbsp;many years old and has a&nbsp;long history. In&nbsp;the 1980s, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>James Spader</a> starred in&nbsp;<i>Stargate</i> and <i>Crash</i>.</p><p><h2>14. Alan Ruck</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ac/c77/11ef3e5b36b0f4bb59cbd5849e.jpg><p>Films such as&nbsp;<i>Ferry’s Bueller Day Off</i>, <i>Star Trek: Next Generation</i> and <i>Speed</i> are on&nbsp;the resume of&nbsp;this legendary <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a>.
