Even though most children as&nbsp;young as&nbsp;4&nbsp;years old understand the concept of&nbsp;unsafe and safe touch, getting into details without a&nbsp;plan can make things go&nbsp;sideways. If&nbsp;it’s not handled carefully it&nbsp;can confuse your kid and they might end up&nbsp;with more questions than answers. Once they learn about the difference, your kid will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;react accordingly and inform you in&nbsp;time, before things go&nbsp;the wrong way.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;help you easily open up&nbsp;with your child and make this conversation more comfortable and successful, even if&nbsp;your kid is&nbsp;still young.</p><p><h2>1. Talk to&nbsp;your child in&nbsp;a&nbsp;quiet place away from distractions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d9/7e3/c22e5f5c94949dff66606e79a4.jpg><p>The first step is&nbsp;essential for this conversation to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful and that is&nbsp;why It’s important that you also feel ready to&nbsp;talk about safe and unsafe touch, and not to&nbsp;force the subject. Start by&nbsp;choosing a&nbsp;quiet place where you can talk to&nbsp;your kid without being disturbed. Make the scene more comfortable by&nbsp;holding your kid’s hands, or&nbsp;sit together on&nbsp;the couch or&nbsp;floor.</p><p>Explain to&nbsp;your kid that it’s not&nbsp;ok:</p><ul><li>to&nbsp;touch someone else’s private parts</li><li>for someone to&nbsp;touch his/her own private parts in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you</li><li>for someone to&nbsp;ask you to&nbsp;touch his/her private parts</li><li>for someone to&nbsp;ask you to&nbsp;take your clothes off or&nbsp;take videos or&nbsp;photos while naked</li><li>for someone to&nbsp;show you videos or&nbsp;photos of&nbsp;naked people</li></ul><p><h2>2. Let them compare safe and unsafe touch.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a00/e2a/c508ac5cfcae410f5c1d2fff26.jpg><p>After you’ve had your first talk, it’s time to&nbsp;let your kid explain to&nbsp;you what unsafe and safe touch means. In&nbsp;this way, you’ll be&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;how much your kid learned and understood from your last conversation. Stay engaged and ask for an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;both types of&nbsp;touch. You can also do&nbsp;a&nbsp;role-play and ask your kid, “What would you do&nbsp;if...?” or&nbsp;“Who will you tell about...?” and so&nbsp;on. Your kid should understand that a&nbsp;handshake, a&nbsp;hug from someone you trust, pats on&nbsp;the back, and an&nbsp;arm around your shoulder are safe.</p><p>However, an&nbsp;unsafe touch is&nbsp;if:</p><ul><li>someone threatens to&nbsp;hurt you if&nbsp;you speak about the situation</li><li>someone asks you not to&nbsp;tell anyone</li><li>someone forces you to&nbsp;touch her/him</li><li>the touch makes you nervous and scared</li><li>a&nbsp;person touches you and this makes you uncomfortable</li><li>a&nbsp;person touches you on&nbsp;your body where you don’t like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;touched</li><li>it&nbsp;hurts you</li></ul><p><h2>3. Explain that even a&nbsp;safe touch can sometimes hurt.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18c/a70/33d1fd5288a5d74ce54141e048.jpg><p>Young children can often have mixed feelings and describe a&nbsp;safe touch as&nbsp;an&nbsp;unsafe one. This usually happens when they feel pain or&nbsp;when they get touched by&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor, who for them is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stranger. Use an&nbsp;example like removing a&nbsp;splinter, it&nbsp;can hurt, but doing it&nbsp;will keep them healthy and it’s considered a&nbsp;safe touch.</p><p>The key here is&nbsp;to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;your child that their doctor will sometimes need to&nbsp;touch their private parts in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;complete their check-up. Of&nbsp;course, tell your kid that you’ll always be&nbsp;there to&nbsp;make sure everything is&nbsp;ok.</p><p><h2>4. Use bikinis to&nbsp;explain private parts</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/087/afb/c49dc355b488b72264555d80b9.jpg><p>Many of&nbsp;you probably avoid the topic of&nbsp;body parts and intercourse with your child, thinking that your kid is&nbsp;still too young, but this is&nbsp;why offenders have the advantage. You should be&nbsp;open with your kid and talk about age-appropriate intimate acts and discuss private parts with respect. Being closed off from this topic and being protective over it&nbsp;can give your kid the wrong signal and idea. Even if&nbsp;your children have experienced something inappropriate, they won’t open up&nbsp;thinking that talking about intimate parts can get them in&nbsp;trouble or&nbsp;that you will get mad.</p><p>If&nbsp;you don’t feel comfortable talking about the names of&nbsp;the intimate body parts use a&nbsp;bikini as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example. Explain that touching a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the body that a&nbsp;bikini covers is&nbsp;considered an&nbsp;unsafe touch. This will give them a&nbsp;good visual perspective without you having to&nbsp;use the proper names.</p><p><h2>5. Explain that unsafe touch is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;“secret.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/323/5c2/8879a85411a6e1c2537369ce45.jpg><p>Most child abusers will tell the abused child to&nbsp;keep the situation a&nbsp;secret and, in&nbsp;most cases, kids listen to&nbsp;this because they think it’s their fault, or&nbsp;they are afraid of&nbsp;the abuser. Explain to&nbsp;your kids that if&nbsp;someone says to&nbsp;keep the unsafe touching a&nbsp;secret, they have to&nbsp;tell you immediately or&nbsp;tell someone your kids know and can truly trust. Here, it’s important to&nbsp;give them examples to&nbsp;make them feel more empowered and act, when necessary, and to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;simpler you can practice role-playing for this step too.</p><p><h2>6. Tell them that they have the right to&nbsp;say “no.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d21/9e2/c24e5a59a8a893547e064b9606.jpg><p>About&nbsp;<a href=#>70%</a> of&nbsp;abuse cases happen with an&nbsp;abuser that the child knew and trusted. That is&nbsp;why an&nbsp;inappropriate touch, even by&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend or&nbsp;trusted relative, can become confusing for a&nbsp;child. After all, you have been teaching them to&nbsp;trust those people and the sudden change of&nbsp;action can make them feel not only confused but scared and conflicted.</p><p>This is&nbsp;why you should tell your kids that they have the full right to&nbsp;say and even scream&nbsp;NO! to&nbsp;any type of&nbsp;unsafe touch. Always reinforce this idea, tell them that they own their body and they can do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;protect&nbsp;it.</p><p>Your child has the right&nbsp;to:</p><ul><li>Say no&nbsp;and tell someone that you don’t want and that you don’t like being touched</li><li>Run away immediately from the abusive person who has been touching you. Never again be&nbsp;alone with that person.</li><li>Call out for help, and even scream</li><li>Believe in&nbsp;yourself, it’s not your fault and you didn’t do&nbsp;anything wrong</li></ul><p><h2>7. Get your children to&nbsp;name a&nbsp;few people they can talk to&nbsp;if&nbsp;someone is&nbsp;touching them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f5/b6d/abcedd5d71ba2299a276620f56.jpg><p>Get your kids to&nbsp;name at&nbsp;least 5&nbsp;people who they think they can trust in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;abuse. Someone your child can run to&nbsp;when a&nbsp;person is&nbsp;practicing unsafe touch. If&nbsp;they can’t think of&nbsp;someone, then help them to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so. Also, remind your kids that they should keep telling people about the situation until someone takes action and helps them, and to&nbsp;never give&nbsp;up.</p><p>Have you had this talk with your kid?
