Roberts’ parents ran an&nbsp;acting school for children in&nbsp;Georgia, and in&nbsp;1963, they co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop there. Eric Roberts has 2&nbsp;younger sisters, <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> and <a href=#>Lisa Roberts Gillan</a>, who are also actors. In&nbsp;1972, Roberts’ parents got divorced, and he&nbsp;stayed with his father in&nbsp;Atlanta, apart from his sisters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2fb/46b/c95ffb55c8aa327949c551e322.jpg><p>Roberts’ first <a href=#>big role</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie was in&nbsp;King of&nbsp;the Gypsies in&nbsp;1978, for which he&nbsp;received a&nbsp;Golden Globe Award nomination. Other significant early roles of&nbsp;Roberts’ include those in&nbsp;Paul’s Case (1980), Raggedy Man (1981), Star 80 (1983), The Pope of&nbsp;Greenwich Village (1984), <i>Runaway Train</i> (1985), Nobody’s Fool (1986), and Best of&nbsp;the Best (1989). At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;his career, Roberts also <a href=#>starred</a> in&nbsp;TV shows like Another World (1977), Miss Lonelyhearts (1983), Slow Burn (1986), and more.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;brilliant acting career with more than 400 roles in&nbsp;movies and shows</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a1/0f2/dcc1c057918d7cf72cd71b863b.jpg><p>As&nbsp;time went&nbsp;by, Roberts landed role after role, which eventually turned into hundreds of&nbsp;appearances both on&nbsp;the big screen and on&nbsp;TV. No&nbsp;matter what your movie preferences are, you’re likely to&nbsp;find something Roberts has been&nbsp;in, simply because there are so&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them, and because they’re so&nbsp;diverse. We&nbsp;<a href=#>saw</a> the actor on&nbsp;the big screen in&nbsp;hits like Final Analysis (1992), The Specialist (1994), The Dark Knight (2008), Deadline (2012), Starcrossed (2014), Papa (2018), Night Walk (2019), and many others. Are there any roles this guy can’t play?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c3/742/2fbc2f518384b0da517aceaa93.jpg><p>The list of&nbsp;TV shows that Eric Roberts has starred in&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite extensive as&nbsp;well. In&nbsp;1996, he&nbsp;<a href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;Doctor Who, and from the year 2002 to&nbsp;2005&nbsp;we enjoyed Roberts’ role in&nbsp;Less Than Perfect. Then, from 2010 to&nbsp;2011, we&nbsp;watched him play Vance Abrams in&nbsp;The Young and Restless. He&nbsp;also appeared in&nbsp;many other <a href=#>shows</a>, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was just in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few episodes. The Odyssey, CSI: Miami, Entourage, Suits, Scorpion, and Grey’s Anatomy are just a&nbsp;few&nbsp;TV shows where you could see Eric Roberts&nbsp;— and we&nbsp;hope you didn’t miss any of&nbsp;them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f3/c18/a5ee3653e1a476bd0b6e77c111.jpg><p>The list of&nbsp;Roberts’ works seem endless, and all his movies and shows together make up&nbsp;for more than 400&nbsp;<a href=#>roles</a>. But it’s not just movies and&nbsp;TV shows that make Eric Roberts one of&nbsp;the busiest celebrities. He’s also been the <a href=#>star</a> of&nbsp;many music videos, like Mr. Brightside by&nbsp;The Killers, Nearly Forgot My&nbsp;Broken Heart by&nbsp;Chris Cornell, and hits It’s Like That and We&nbsp;Belong Together by&nbsp;Mariah Carey&nbsp;— just to&nbsp;name a&nbsp;few.</p><p><h2>Eliza Roberts, wife and supporter</h2></p><p>The actor and Eliza got <a href=#>married</a> in&nbsp;1992 and since then, she’s not only served as&nbsp;his wife, but as&nbsp;his friend and his <a href=#>manager</a> as&nbsp;well. Eric Roberts was always happy to&nbsp;work devotedly, and Eliza made sure he&nbsp;took part in&nbsp;every project he&nbsp;could. Eliza <a href=#>recollects</a> that once he&nbsp;even starred in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house commercial, pretending to&nbsp;live there with his “fake” family. It&nbsp;looks like doing so&nbsp;much work made the actor happy. “And so&nbsp;suddenly, it’s like 250&nbsp;movies, and I&nbsp;realize, I&nbsp;went from being a&nbsp;joke that’ll do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;being ‘Is there anything he&nbsp;can’t do?’” the actor <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>Eric Roberts today</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d45/9fc/ccbc485006ba9b34fb20dde152.jpg><p>After 4&nbsp;decades of&nbsp;acting, Roberts is&nbsp;still one of&nbsp;the busiest actors in&nbsp;Hollywood who’s starring in&nbsp;multiple projects and is&nbsp;still enthusiastic about his profession. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his recent interviews, Roberts <a href=#>credited</a> his wife, Eliza, for his rich acting career, saying that she “runs the show” getting him so&nbsp;many amazing roles. It’s interesting that the couple <a href=#>mentioned</a> their working together as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the secrets to&nbsp;their long and happy marriage.</p><p>We&nbsp;look forward to&nbsp;seeing Eric Roberts in&nbsp;new movies and shows and we&nbsp;hope he&nbsp;keeps pleasing our eyes and ears with his marvelous acting for many more years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Which movies and shows with Eric Roberts have you watched?
