Although this was only an hour-long episode, it was one of the most exciting of the season. Since Blind Auditions are wrapping up next Monday, times are tense as coaches pick their final artists.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-surprises-with-special-britney-spears-appearance>The Voice Surprises With Special Britney Spears Appearance</h2><p>The next installment of the Blind Auditions began with 37 year old Willie Gomez. The Miami, Florida based singer impressed with his rendition of “La Bachata” by Manuel Turizo. This rendition was enough to turn each coach chair, within a few minutes.</p><p>Ahead of Willie’s audition, the singer talked about how he is able to sing, but also able to dance. Before appearing on the show, he’s danced with Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. There was even a video of Spears wishing Willie well on the show.</p><p>After the coaches all complimented the singer, or flirted with them if you’re Gwen Stefani, Willie decided to join Team Legend. At this rate, it’s safe to say that Legend has gotten the majority of Four-Chair auditioners.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’re loving and dancing to <a href=#>@williegomez</a> performing "La Bachata" by Manuel Turizo! 🕺💃 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GKCvKloQb0</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 11, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bold-singer-performs-niall-horan-s-hit-this-town>Bold Singer Performs Niall Horan’s Hit “This Town”</h2><p>In an iconic moment, Horan was the first coach to turn for the artist. The 15 year old singer, Olivia Eden, was clearly excited to see the coach.</p><p>“Great song choice, I know that one well,” Horan said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s no surprise that <a href=#>@oliviaedenmusic</a> showed the Coaches that she can rule “This Town” 😉 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YYtO9wXWfb</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 11, 2023</a><p>Following Olivia’s performance, the show aired her background package. If Olivia looked familiar to you, you’re probably remembering her from her time on Top Chef Junior. She was on the series at 10 years old, although she loved cooking at the time, she knew she wanted to be a singer. Now, she’s pursuing that dream on The Voice.</p><p>When it came down to Olivia’s team, she had the choice of joining Team Niall or Team Reba. She ended up picking Team Niall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-r-amp-b-singer-premieres-silky-smooth-impressive-runs>R&B Singer Premieres Silky Smooth, Impressive Runs</h2><p>The second to last Blind Audition of the night featured Kara Tenae singing “Booed Up” by Ella Mai. This rendition turned the chairs of McEntire, Stefani, and Horan. Surprisingly, Legend didn’t turn around for this R&B singer.</p><p>Following her audition, each coach complimented her totality and silky smooth runs. Like Horan admitted when the chairs turned, it was clear from Kara’s outfit that she may want to join Team Gwen. Horan was right afterall, since Kara chose Team Gwen.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kara Tenae is runnin' the show with her performance of “Boo’d Up” by Ella Mai! 🎶 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7E85dotcow</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 11, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-music-teacher-earns-final-four-chair-turn-of-the-episode>Music Teacher Earns Final Four-Chair Turn of The Episode</h2><p>The final singer of the episode is Gospel singer Caleb Sasser. Caleb’s Blind Audition featured a rendition “Another Sad Love Song” by Toni Braxton, which involves more of a jazz tone. His rendition of the song turned the chairs of Legend, Horan, Stefani and McEntire.</p><p>Although it was clear that Caleb would want to pick Legend, the other coaches still put up a fight. Stefani made sure to mention that she could help Caleb get out of his shell, Horan noted that Caleb could shine on his time and McEntire explained that she would’ve asked Caleb to be apart of her duet album.</p><p>After all the compliments and pressure, Caleb decided to join Team Legend. This was a great pick for Caleb, since Legend can help him blossom on the series. Stefani hopes that she’ll be able to steal Caleb in the Battle Rounds.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s another AMAZING love song rendition by <a href=#>@thecalebsasser</a>! ❤️ <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ccffpsnNDy</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 11, 2023</a><p>The Voice returns to NBC on Monday, October 16 at 8 p.m. ET.
