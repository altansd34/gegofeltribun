On an episode of &nbsp;Essentials Radio&nbsp;on Apple Music, Miranda dished about the true meaning behind the song and the sentiment it held for the Shelton family.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miranda-lambert-recalls-writing-over-you-with-blake-shelton>Miranda Lambert Recalls Writing ‘Over You’ With Blake Shelton</h2><p>Blake’s brother Richie was killed in a car accident in 1990 at age 24. “My ex-husband, Blake, had lost a brother and it’s one of those moments where even if you’re married to someone, sometimes you find something new about them,” Miranda said. “Dudes don’t open up about things but he started telling me about the experience of it all. And I was like, ‘Have you ever written about it?'”</p><p>Blake had never written about it before. His dad always said “‘You don’t get over it. You just get used to it.” Miranda asked Blake if he wanted to try writing the song but questioned if it was “invasive.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MIRANDA LAMBERT SILENT ON BLAKE SHELTON AND GWEN STEFANI’S ENGAGEMENT BUT HER FANS ARE NOT!</a></strong></p><p>“I would never try to write your story because I didn’t live it, but maybe I could help because I’m an outside perspective but I feel your pain talking to me right now” she suggested to Blake. After writing the song together, the duo later won a CMA Award&nbsp;for Song of the Year in 2012.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Miranda reflected back on that songwriting experience. “It was really a special moment and I’m so glad we shared that song and that it helped his family heal, to have that together,” she said.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-and-miranda-have-both-moved-on-from-their-failed-marriage>Blake And Miranda Have Both Moved On From Their Failed Marriage</h3><p>Blake and Miranda met in 2005 just as their huge country music careers were taking off. They dated for five years and got engaged in 2010. They really solidified themselves as one of country musics hottest couples.</p><p>The pair began building their life together in Oklahoma but Blake’s career began to take him all over the world. He has been on&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;since the very first season, always touring and spending time in the studio.

They put out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a joint statement</a> saying “This is not the future we envisioned. And it is with heavy hearts that we move forward separately.”</p><p>Blake went public with his relationship with Gwen Stefani in 2015. The pair met&nbsp;on&nbsp;The Voice the year prior. Gwen was going through a divorce of her own at the time from Gavin Rossdale.
