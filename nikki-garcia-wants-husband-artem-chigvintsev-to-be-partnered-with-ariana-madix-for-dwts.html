The reality show star rose to prominence earlier this year when her longtime partner, Tom Sandoval, cheated on her with their friend, Raquel Leviss.</p><p>The scandal, which was dubbed the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scandoval</a>,” was a major storyline on Vanderpump Rules, and it left Madix heartbroken. Garcia believes that Madix’s story would be a powerful one to tell on DWTS.</p><p>“You can tell her story so beautifully in a contemporary dance or ballroom dance,” Garcia said. “I think it would be really special.”</p><p>Madix has not yet been paired with a partner for DWTS, but she has been spotted out to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lunch</a> with Derek Hough. For those who may not know, Hough is a six-time Mirrorball champion, and current DWTS judge.</p><p>Of course, no pairings are official yet, and it is still possible that Chigvintsev will not be return for DWTS for Season 32. However, if he does, Garcia’s hopes a Madix-Chigvintsev partnership could become a reality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ariana Madix Opened Up About Mental Struggles</h2><p>In addition to the “Scandoval,” Madix has also opened up about her struggles with anxiety and depression. She has said that she hopes to use her platform on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> to raise awareness about these issues.</p><p>“I think it’s important to talk about mental health,” Madix said. “It’s something that I’ve struggled with, and I know a lot of people do.”</p><p>Madix will most likely be one of the most talked-about contestants of the season, since Scandoval is still pretty fresh. Her story is both inspiring and heartbreaking, and she has the potential to make a real impact on viewers. Whether she is partnered with Chigvintsev or other pros, Madix is sure to be a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>While the official full cast announcement is yet to come, fans are buzzing with excitement and speculation. DWTS season 32 is premiering&nbsp;this fall&nbsp;on ABC and Disney+ and will once again air Mondays at 8/7.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NUP_195977_00106-e1637719839592.jpg alt="Ariana Grande, Dalton Gomez Have Reportedly Separated After 2 Years of Marriage" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKipKFdnK6zr8iaZLCZnqnAbrTUrJmappRirrPAxKZknKCZnMOqutOsnK9lpKR6o7GMqZirrJ6av6awjLCgraBdlr%2Bqrc2aZKaZlJ7FbrLOq2Sdr6SofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./magician-manipulates-sand-in-agt-early-release-audition.html><span>←</span><span>Magician Manipulates Sand in 'AGT' Early Release Audition</span></a>
