Forty-two percent of these respondents said they preferred using taxis -- which generally have set fares based on wait times, distance traveled, and other factors -- during these high-cost periods, while 34 percent still preferred ride-hailing apps, and another 24 percent didn’t know or had no opinion.</p><p class=mb-s>In response to an increase in ride-hailing usership and traffic congestion, along with a subsequent decline in taxi ridership, the New York City Council voted in August to cap the number of licenses available to ride-hailing services for one year, the first such limit placed by a major U.S. city on ride-hailing platforms.</p><p class=mb-s>Johnice Earle, a business agent with the Washington D.C. Taxi Operators Association, said she “absolutely” believes there should be a cap on the number of ride-hailing drivers operating within the District of Columbia, saying that “if there are 10 digital dispatch operators for every one taxi cab, there is no balance” between services. But Earle said D.C. has not yet taken the lead in pursuing any such proposal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOmqSeqpmYrq%2B%2FjLCfqGWlqLJuvsidnGagkZ65qrrGZqqeqqaesKa%2FjJyYm6tdpb%2BmssSrZJ%2BnoqKys3nEr5ynZZGev7G70a2q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./age-difference.html><span>←</span><span>Age difference</span></a>
