There’s no&nbsp;such thing as&nbsp;“the right woman.” The most important thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with the man at&nbsp;the right time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/978/c30/1206dc562daf2e3cfc804674a6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;social media, someone posted the opinion that men get married not when they meet “the love of&nbsp;their life” but when they are ready to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. A&nbsp;Twitter user got really interested in&nbsp;this theory and <a href=#>asked</a> men to&nbsp;comment on&nbsp;it. And almost unanimously, men admitted that <strong>they had a&nbsp;relationship they regretted ending</strong> but it&nbsp;didn’t stop them from getting married when they had a&nbsp;fitting woman to&nbsp;become their wife.</p><p><strong>There’s another popular thing that triggers men to&nbsp;get married</strong>: if&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman they’ve wanted to&nbsp;get with for a&nbsp;long time gets married, they want to&nbsp;get married as&nbsp;well. In&nbsp;this case, they feel that there’s no&nbsp;chance with that other women and if&nbsp;the loneliness becomes unbearable, the unlucky guy chooses among his available options. So, it&nbsp;seems that men don’t wait for the “right woman” and whatever girl that is&nbsp;ready for <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain time will get the proposal.</p><p><strong>Scientists say that the <a href=#>best age</a> for starting a&nbsp;family</strong> is&nbsp;from 28&nbsp;to&nbsp;32. After this time, the chances that a&nbsp;man will want to&nbsp;get married will drop and after the age of&nbsp;42, the chance is&nbsp;almost&nbsp;0.</p><p><h2>2. There’s no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;family based on&nbsp;physical attraction.</h2></p><p>Studies <a href=#>show</a> that couples with a&nbsp;woman that is&nbsp;more attractive than the man are the happiest. But as&nbsp;John T. Molloy (the author of&nbsp;the <a href=#>book</a> Why Men Marry Some Woman and Not Others) said, the appearance of&nbsp;the woman shouldn’t be&nbsp;vulgar. John asked more than 3,500 men to&nbsp;describe their brides and only&nbsp;20% of&nbsp;the fiances used adjectives that had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with their appearance (like gorgeous, attractive, or&nbsp;sexy). And the other&nbsp;80% mentioned the woman’s character traits. Men said that being clean and presentable is&nbsp;very important but didn’t want them to&nbsp;look over-the-top. The most popular opinion was this: a&nbsp;woman should look so&nbsp;that it’s not a&nbsp;shame to&nbsp;appear with her in&nbsp;public.</p><p><h2>3. The opinion of&nbsp;friends and parents can affect the decision.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc9/d3e/5574235d579871074311fe3a27.jpg><p>Even if&nbsp;a&nbsp;man looks very independent, <strong>who he&nbsp;chooses as&nbsp;a&nbsp;wife will be&nbsp;influenced by&nbsp;those close to&nbsp;him</strong>. That’s why <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> play <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;huge role</a> in&nbsp;the beginning stage of&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship, and their opinions may speed up&nbsp;the process of&nbsp;falling in&nbsp;love. Additionally, a&nbsp;man’s parents’ approval may also be&nbsp;a&nbsp;decisive factor in&nbsp;the proposal. You probably have seen cases where a&nbsp;parent’s expectations are different from the girl their son brings home.</p><p><h2>4. Men are sure that women are totally satisfied.</h2></p><p>To&nbsp;be&nbsp;more specific, women may just pretend that everything is&nbsp;okay when really, they don’t want to&nbsp;get married. However, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman never voices her opinion about wanting to&nbsp;get married, <strong>her boyfriend will never know that she is&nbsp;expecting some kind of&nbsp;gesture</strong> from him because men are bad at&nbsp;reading between the lines. But men are good at&nbsp;making conclusions. So, when this girl loses her patience, packs her stuff and leaves, the man will analyze the situation and when he&nbsp;meets the next woman, he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;quicker in&nbsp;his decisions and will propose to&nbsp;her before she leaves him.</p><p>Psychologists <a href=#>claim</a> that couples that have few conflicts in&nbsp;the very beginning don’t have a&nbsp;future so&nbsp;people shouldn’t be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;expressing their opinions. <strong>The women that prefer to&nbsp;be&nbsp;silent about their wishes never actually get the wedding ring</strong>.&nbsp;73% of&nbsp;future wives admit that they pressed their significant others and insisted on&nbsp;getting married instead of&nbsp;just waiting for their boyfriend to&nbsp;propose to&nbsp;them on&nbsp;their own.</p><p><h2>5. Living together decreases the chances of&nbsp;getting married by&nbsp;50%.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c49/e93/cd197953e5845759c0af7529f1.jpg><p>Psychologists warn women that they should be&nbsp;very careful about the idea of&nbsp;living together before marriage. Most men make a&nbsp;proposal 22&nbsp;months after the beginning of&nbsp;the relationship and after this period, the chance <a href=#>decreases</a> by&nbsp;20% and 3&nbsp;years later, this number is&nbsp;only 50%. <strong>And after 7&nbsp;years, the chances of&nbsp;getting married are at&nbsp;0%</strong>.</p><p>But don’t forget about the difference in&nbsp;perception: women think that living together is&nbsp;the first step to&nbsp;marriage and men, on&nbsp;the contrary, “forget” about the necessity to&nbsp;register the relationship and already think that they have a&nbsp;family.</p><p><h2>6. A&nbsp;woman is&nbsp;convenient for this period of&nbsp;time but not for the future.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f29/22d/97d8ba57c699b3b21550904c25.jpg><p>Sometimes, men want to&nbsp;get married but only when they achieve certain things in&nbsp;their lives like a&nbsp;promotion, an&nbsp;apartment, a&nbsp;house, and so&nbsp;on. They don’t want to&nbsp;stay alone during this difficult life period while he’s pursuing his goals, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;looks for a&nbsp;woman to&nbsp;support him&nbsp;— but only temporarily.</p><p>“A&nbsp;convenient” woman who doesn’t require much and that will always meet him halfway is&nbsp;<strong>not enough for the life he&nbsp;wants</strong>. She doesn’t challenge him or&nbsp;encourage an&nbsp;<a href=#>addiction</a>. And if&nbsp;a&nbsp;man becomes successful, they want to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;shape and in&nbsp;this situation, he&nbsp;needs a&nbsp;woman that will challenge him all the time, helping him to&nbsp;achieve more and more.</p><p><h2>7. Not all relationships are supposed to&nbsp;end with a&nbsp;wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dcd/499/964d935d9b8bd5c18eacaccb11.jpg><p>From early childhood, girls are taught that any boys that pay attention to&nbsp;them automatically become their “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>one and only</a>.” Very often, relatives joke about this and ask girls when the wedding is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;happen. But year after year, this question becomes more and more serious. And girls grow up&nbsp;with the stereotype that <strong>if&nbsp;the relationship is&nbsp;long, it&nbsp;can only have one end&nbsp;— the forming of&nbsp;a&nbsp;family</strong>. But men rarely have the same pressure put upon them, so&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;big misunderstanding between the sexes.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, people regret any time they wasted dating and often try to&nbsp;hold on&nbsp;to&nbsp;significant others. But then they have to&nbsp;live with the notion that this person is&nbsp;only with them because they feel they need to&nbsp;be, not because they want to&nbsp;be. Also, men rarely give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;their wishes, and if&nbsp;they’re certain about their choice, they won’t wait too long or&nbsp;avoid having the conversation. There’s no&nbsp;such thing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;true bachelor (right, George Clooney?), there are just women that men don’t want to&nbsp;marry but are too afraid to&nbsp;say&nbsp;it.</p><p>Maybe, you have your own thoughts and experience on&nbsp;this topic and the men you know proposed&nbsp;or (didn’t) for other reasons.
