Few of&nbsp;us have ever thought there was any difference in&nbsp;the way paternal and maternal grandmothers influence their grandchildren. According to&nbsp;scientists, however, there is&nbsp;something special we&nbsp;get from our maternal grandmothers apart from their love and affection.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> we’ve studied some theories on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;maternal grandmother in&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s life and here’s what we’ve found.</p><p><h2>What do&nbsp;we&nbsp;share with our grandparents?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0b/525/2fc0115086b3c1a0dc053a8a27.jpg><p>Genes are basic <a href=#>units</a> of&nbsp;heredity made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=# title=DNA data-link=tag>DNA</a>. According to&nbsp;genetics, <strong>grandparents <a href=#>share</a> on&nbsp;average&nbsp;25% of&nbsp;their DNA with their grandchildren </strong>with the exact percentage depending on&nbsp;the DNA swapping. We&nbsp;inherit our genes from both our male and female grandparents, of&nbsp;course, but according to&nbsp;scientists it’s the maternal grandmothers who have the higher degree of&nbsp;influence on&nbsp;the offspring.</p><p><h2>There’s something special our grandmothers give&nbsp;us.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db4/049/58e0295d17b702231ff7488d7b.jpg><p>Maternal grandmothers have closer connection with their grandchildren, as&nbsp;they give birth to&nbsp;the mothers who in&nbsp;their turn give birth to&nbsp;the children. In&nbsp;many <a href=# title=families data-link=tag>families</a> maternal grandmothers <a href=#>tend</a> to&nbsp;bear more responsibility for the kids and spend more time with them. It’s not only the psychological connection that makes the role of&nbsp;maternal grandmothers so&nbsp;important but some <strong>theories suggest that genetically-speaking paternal and maternal grandmothers unequally invest in&nbsp;their grandchildren</strong>.</p><p><h2>Scientific theories prove that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong genetic bond between maternal grandmothers and their children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba6/71c/8e711758a2980fbb89cf4d29a6.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the <a href=#>theories</a> claims that the difference in&nbsp;the way paternal and maternal grandmothers are connected to&nbsp;their grandchildren may be&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;the X-chromosome connection. <strong>Maternal grandmothers have 25% X&nbsp;relatedness to&nbsp;both grandsons and granddaughters</strong>, while paternal grandmothers pass on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their X-chromosomes to&nbsp;their granddaughters, but not to&nbsp;their grandsons. This makes paternal grandmothers 50% X-related to&nbsp;their granddaughters and 0%&nbsp;X-related to&nbsp;their grandsons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18e/f7c/455c945bbca385383c92a5eb9f.jpg><p>Another <a href=#>theory</a> suggests that the so-called “paternal uncertainty” may greatly influence the grandparents’ incentive to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;their grandchildren. Paternal uncertainty implies that male members of&nbsp;the family may not always be&nbsp;sure they are bringing up&nbsp;their own children, as&nbsp;they do&nbsp;not give birth themselves. In&nbsp;the long run <strong>it&nbsp;may decrease the engagement of&nbsp;paternal relatives, including grandmothers, into caretaking behavior toward the offspring</strong>. At&nbsp;the same time, a&nbsp;woman is&nbsp;always sure she gave the birth to&nbsp;her child which makes the matrilineal connection the strongest in&nbsp;the family throughout generations.</p><p><h2>Other theories suggesting the unique role of&nbsp;the maternal grandmother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/989/40e/550d9150128fb98dcd965ff079.jpg><p>This theory that was developed by&nbsp;the Chilean novelist, essayist and playwright Alejandro Jodorowsky, <a href=#>suggests</a> that <strong>of&nbsp;all the 4&nbsp;grandparents we&nbsp;are most tightly connected to&nbsp;our maternal grandmothers</strong>. According to&nbsp;his <a href=#>theory</a>, our genes may “skip” a&nbsp;generation and be&nbsp;passed from our grandparents directly to&nbsp;us, which can be&nbsp;proven by&nbsp;the fact that some people resemble their grandparents more than their moms and dads. Jodorowsky <a href=#>believes</a> that apart from biological material, mothers pass on&nbsp;<a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a> to&nbsp;their daughters who later pass them on&nbsp;to&nbsp;their children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b8/73f/523ba6552d8f77b105015fc604.jpg><p>The theories we’ve just shared with you speak about the special role of&nbsp;the maternal grandmother in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child. We&nbsp;are all different, however, and we&nbsp;have different families with different ties and relationships. So, let&nbsp;us be&nbsp;thankful and<strong> appreciate the love, care, and wisdom our grandfathers and grandmothers give&nbsp;us, regardless of&nbsp;the genetic relatedness</strong>.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;these theories?
