We&nbsp;will call my&nbsp;wife Meg and my&nbsp;daughter Jess. Jess is&nbsp;in&nbsp;her junior year of&nbsp;college. We&nbsp;usually go&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit Jess a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times throughout the semester.</p><p>Let me&nbsp;start by&nbsp;saying that traveling with my&nbsp;wife is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;great experience. I&nbsp;am very type A, I&nbsp;like to&nbsp;have everything organized and make sure that we&nbsp;get where we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;early, especially when traveling. My&nbsp;wife is&nbsp;the opposite, very ‘go&nbsp;with the flow’ and ‘we&nbsp;will get there when we&nbsp;get there.’ I&nbsp;do my&nbsp;best to&nbsp;meet in&nbsp;the middle, but not when traveling by&nbsp;plane.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e6e/4f8/5e4bad530aaf910925605a1c74.jpg><p>“Last year, during parents’ weekend Meg and&nbsp;I were going to&nbsp;fly out to&nbsp;see Jess. Our flight was at&nbsp;10&nbsp;am. I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;wife that we&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;the airport 90&nbsp;minutes early, and we&nbsp;live about 30&nbsp;minutes from the airport. This being said&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;leave at&nbsp;the very latest by&nbsp;8. I&nbsp;of&nbsp;course got up&nbsp;at&nbsp;6, to&nbsp;make sure everything was ready and accounted for.</p><p>My&nbsp;wife does not like to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;early. It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;attempting to&nbsp;wake her up&nbsp;5&nbsp;times before she eventually got up&nbsp;at&nbsp;7:40. We&nbsp;didn’t leave the house until 9. It&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;being busier at&nbsp;the airport than normal, and it&nbsp;took so&nbsp;long to&nbsp;get through security that we&nbsp;missed our flight.”</p><p>“Fast-forward to&nbsp;now. We&nbsp;take one flight from our town to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bigger town nearby, then fly from there to&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter’s college town. Again it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;long morning of&nbsp;me&nbsp;pushing my&nbsp;wife getting her to&nbsp;move along. Due to&nbsp;the last airport mishap&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;make sure&nbsp;I told her we&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;leave extra early as&nbsp;to&nbsp;not miss the flight again.</p><p>We&nbsp;got there on&nbsp;time, with a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;time to&nbsp;spare. We&nbsp;took our first flight and landed in&nbsp;the connecting city, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;much larger airport. We&nbsp;only had about 1&nbsp;hour layover. We&nbsp;got off the plane at&nbsp;9:15 and our next plane started boarding at&nbsp;9:40. We&nbsp;had to&nbsp;take multiple rails to&nbsp;get from where we&nbsp;landed to&nbsp;our terminal. We&nbsp;got to&nbsp;our terminal and had about 15&nbsp;minutes until our plane was set to&nbsp;board.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/907/26f/e5ab685973b50b04958b4f10fd.jpg><p>“My&nbsp;wife tells me&nbsp;that she wants to&nbsp;get <a href=# title=coffee data-link=tag>coffee</a>. There was a&nbsp;little market next to&nbsp;our terminal that sold hot food and coffee. I&nbsp;asked if&nbsp;she wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;grab it&nbsp;for her. ‘No, I&nbsp;want Starbucks’ she said. Well Starbucks was a&nbsp;rail ride away, and a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;walk.</p><p>I&nbsp;told her we&nbsp;couldn’t do&nbsp;that, we&nbsp;didn’t have enough time. She stated that we&nbsp;had enough time and if&nbsp;I wouldn’t go&nbsp;with her, she would go&nbsp;by&nbsp;herself. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;discourage her but she was determined. She walked away, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;brisk pace for her, and said she would be&nbsp;back in&nbsp;time.”</p><p>“15&nbsp;minutes went&nbsp;by, and she was nowhere to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen. They started calling boarding groups, I&nbsp;called my&nbsp;wife hoping she was nearby, she didn’t answer. They called a&nbsp;few groups, then called ours. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;panic&nbsp;I called my&nbsp;wife again, 3&nbsp;times, finally on&nbsp;the last call she answered and said she was on&nbsp;her way, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;long line, and she had to&nbsp;wait a&nbsp;bit. I&nbsp;told her they were almost done with boarding, and she needed to&nbsp;hurry&nbsp;up.</p><p>I&nbsp;waited by&nbsp;the gate, but the attendant said they would need to&nbsp;shut the gate in&nbsp;2&nbsp;minutes. I&nbsp;waited and waited, but she didn’t show&nbsp;up. The attendant asked if&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;board, otherwise she was closing the gate. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;plead with her to&nbsp;wait a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes, but she insisted that she couldn’t. So, I&nbsp;boarded the plane.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a5/7de/497501582fbda30ac785b41d36.jpg><p>“A&nbsp;few minutes later my&nbsp;wife calls me&nbsp;saying the attendant won’t let her&nbsp;on, they had already removed the boarding ramp at&nbsp;that point. She told me&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;tell them to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;off the plane to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with her and&nbsp;I said&nbsp;no. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not fair to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this again to&nbsp;Jess. I&nbsp;said, ‘I&nbsp;told you we&nbsp;didn’t have time, but you decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;anyway.’ I&nbsp;told her to&nbsp;go&nbsp;purchase a&nbsp;new ticket for the next flight and&nbsp;I would see her when she arrives.</p><p>She got to&nbsp;Jess’s school and seemed unbothered by&nbsp;the whole situation, didn’t even really talk about&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;thought maybe she realized it&nbsp;was her fault and just wanted to&nbsp;drop&nbsp;it. Boy was I&nbsp;wrong. We&nbsp;are now home, and she hasn’t talked to&nbsp;me&nbsp;since the trip, over a&nbsp;week ago.”</p><p>Many people in&nbsp;the comments were on&nbsp;the Redditor’s side, with one comment <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>: “You need to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;line in&nbsp;the sand. You are not responsible for waking her&nbsp;up. You are not responsible for getting her out the door. She’s an&nbsp;adult, and she can do&nbsp;what she wants.” Another comment also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>: “Your wife is&nbsp;very selfish. Imagine missing time with your child because you thought coffee was more important?”</p><p>While relationships always come with their fair share of&nbsp;issues, sometimes these problems can be&nbsp;bigger than a&nbsp;simple argument, like <a href=#>this woman</a> whose husband demands to&nbsp;know everything that happens in&nbsp;his wife’s day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZurs6aqZ2dlGKubrzLmqWeZZGjsW64xJ%2BrZqWpYsSqssRmmZ6gmaOxbrLOq2SbnZmjtG64wK2cZnBhaoFyfo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-adverbs-frequency-french.html><span>←</span><span>How to Use Adverbs of Frequency in French - Lingoda</span></a>
