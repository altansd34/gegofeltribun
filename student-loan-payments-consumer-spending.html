In October, 66% of federal student loan borrowers said they would need to find additional work or increase their working hours to earn more to help make their student loan payments. But in March 2024, just 52% said they followed through on this action, a 14 percentage point difference.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Missing payments is common for federal student loan borrowers</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Even though many borrowers are making adjustments to their spending to help afford student loan payments, it looks like it’s not enough: many report missing a payment. About half (49%) of federal student loan borrowers said they have missed at least one payment since payments resumed.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Many also worry they’ll continue to miss payments, or worse default on their loans in the future.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Half (50%) of federal student loan borrowers said they will miss one or more payments on their student loans now or in the future, with 27% saying they “definitely will.” Less federal student loan borrowers said they will default, but the shares are still quite high. Roughly 4 in 10 (42%) said they will default on their loans in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Borrowers are planning big changes to their budgets in the future</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In order to hopefully avoid both those scenarios, borrowers are planning to make even further changes to their spending to fit student loan payments into their budgets. The most commonly cited action is cutting back on nonessentials. Roughly 7 in 10 (69%) student loan borrowers said they would take this action in the future to help ensure they can make payments on their loans.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">There’s also potential for more support from the government. In April, President Joe Biden unveiled a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>new plan to forgive student loan debt</a>, which came about a year after the Supreme Court blocked his initial attempt to do so. Biden’s new program is narrower in scope, to help avoid future legal challenges, but still has potential to benefit many borrowers. For example, one provision in the plan that aims to “cancel runaway interest” could impact up to 25 million Americans.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6jBtrDEp6tmpJ%2BWu268wLKknqakqHqku82srKadomLAsbHNnaCnnw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./9807-sorry-lads-your-times-up.html><span>←</span><span>Sorry lads, you're not popular</span></a>
