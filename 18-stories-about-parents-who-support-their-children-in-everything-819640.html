She told her 2 older sisters she wanted to cancel the wedding & they said something to the effect: "You can't - your face is already on the tea towels." That is, on all the commemorative souvenirs that would be sold - seems like it'd be even more interesting to have those things, commemorating "the wedding that never happened.</p><p>The mother of a former co-worker told her to get only half of towels & linens monogrammed "Because the marriage probably won't last." The mother had nothing against the future husband - it was just a slap at her daughter & I can't think why she would have been so cruel. The marriage lasted only a few years, & I don't know anything abt the reasons for the divorce, but wonder if things might possibly have been different if she had had family support during difficult times.</p><p>But on a sweeter note, as my friend & her father stood at the back of the church for a few minutes, just before their walk down the aisle, he turned to her & said, "It's not too late to change your mind if you're not sure this is what you want to do" - no mention of money already spent, no suggestion of "embarrassment" or the complications that would follow - just telling his daughter he loved her & wanted her to be happy. That was in the late '70s, the bride was only 18, & they're still together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH55edKtpquhlah6oq7OrqtmqJGnsq%2FA0mauoaddqMKxvM6rq2asmJq2s3nCoaClnKKau261zWacr52irsGptc2gZHFpaWuBcXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1198365-funny-text-messages-laugh-html.html><span>←</span><span>120+ funny text messages for her to send and make her laugh</span></a>
