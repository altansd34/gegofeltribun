Now, women do&nbsp;not necessarily have to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;home. In&nbsp;some relationships, they are even the breadwinners, while the husband is&nbsp;the one who takes care of&nbsp;the home and children. That is&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;Amy Adams’ husband, Darren Le&nbsp;Gallo, who preferred to&nbsp;quit his job to&nbsp;support his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/97a/a20/0895995cec98f3b3a6bbb2f69d.jpg><p>The relationship between Amy Adams and her husband, Darren, began a&nbsp;long time ago. They met around 2001 in&nbsp;an&nbsp;acting class and have been together ever since. In&nbsp;2008, they got engaged, but the actress’ busy schedule made it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>difficult</a> to&nbsp;set an&nbsp;exact date for the wedding. It&nbsp;wasn’t until 2015 that they tied the knot in&nbsp;a&nbsp;ceremony at&nbsp;which, in&nbsp;the front row, was their daughter, Aviana.</p><p>Amy is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most popular and critically acclaimed actresses. She has starred in&nbsp;many <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> productions and renowned series. Her leap to&nbsp;stardom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>happened</a> in&nbsp;2005 when she worked in&nbsp;<i>Junebug</i> and <i>Enchanted</i>.</p><p>Darren, on&nbsp;the other hand, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist. He&nbsp;got a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;Painting in&nbsp;Texas. Afterward, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moved</a> to&nbsp;Los Angeles, where he&nbsp;met his future wife in&nbsp;acting classes he&nbsp;attended while he&nbsp;was working as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor in&nbsp;several movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a6/e33/46d0fe5a64b251de667f85be07.jpg><p>They started dating a&nbsp;year after they met while filming a&nbsp;project together. At&nbsp;that point, she fell in&nbsp;love with Darren’s personality. In&nbsp;Amy’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>words</a>, “And I&nbsp;just found him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;such a&nbsp;genuine, caring person.” They haven’t been apart since, and on&nbsp;every red carpet she attends, Darren is&nbsp;by&nbsp;her side, supporting her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9c/a8b/0b9dc352dd9560b67641c1ed74.jpg><p>Even though they are both artists and Amy’s career took off like a&nbsp;rocket, Darren has never been jealous of&nbsp;her. On&nbsp;the contrary, he&nbsp;has her back. Amy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>once said</a> about this, “He’s really special. I’m really lucky because he’s not competitive with&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;supports and embraces my&nbsp;success as&nbsp;mine. And he&nbsp;has his own goals for himself, but he&nbsp;never makes my&nbsp;success his failure.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/102/360/a58cca59469d723fc7be5fa871.jpg><p>Amy considers herself lucky, as&nbsp;she has a&nbsp;man by&nbsp;her side who loves, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admires</a>, and always supports her. Darren understands the commitments of&nbsp;the actress and has no&nbsp;objection to&nbsp;waiting for her when necessary.</p><p>They were engaged for many years before they tied the knot. Amy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I’ve been really busy, and&nbsp;I feel like a&nbsp;horrible fiancée that&nbsp;I haven’t gotten swept up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the whole idea of&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding. But I&nbsp;just haven’t. Once you have a&nbsp;great man in&nbsp;your life, it&nbsp;allows you —at least for me— to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;yourself and grow as&nbsp;an&nbsp;individual.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/620/32e/cdb0275f2089f179e9f8adc3de.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2010, while still engaged, they became parents to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby girl, whom they named Aviana. Darren <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accompanies</a> his wife to&nbsp;the different movie locations she has to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;around the world, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;the one who takes care of&nbsp;their daughter. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “He&nbsp;travels with me&nbsp;and helps to&nbsp;keep the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> together, and&nbsp;I really do&nbsp;appreciate that. But I&nbsp;don’t value it&nbsp;because he’s a&nbsp;man doing&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;value it&nbsp;because he’s my&nbsp;partner.”</p><p>Amy and Darren truly grasped the meaning of&nbsp;the word “team” and made one on&nbsp;their own terms. However, some people still have a&nbsp;hard time understanding relationships like this. Amy once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>, “We&nbsp;have a&nbsp;friend who said to&nbsp;him, ‘I couldn’t do&nbsp;what you&nbsp;do, I&nbsp;really couldn’t.’ What, show up&nbsp;for your wife? That’s really sad. But, you know, he&nbsp;has sacrificed a&nbsp;lot.”</p><p>Their love for each other can be&nbsp;seen from miles away. Darren often shares photos and sweet words about his wife on&nbsp;his social media, and Amy, though not as&nbsp;active online, has also shared images with him. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> on&nbsp;her Instagram: “Darren, you are my&nbsp;soft place.”</p><p>What cases do&nbsp;you know of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who stays home to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the children? What do&nbsp;you think are the challenges faced by&nbsp;couples in&nbsp;which women are the ones who work?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKq60qmgq5mknryvedGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqaposZ%2Bqv6Z5zLJkrKeWqXqxuMCcnGallZrBbq3MsmSanJGiwG601KyZmqaUYq5uv9OasGaZpGK1sLnEZpuanF2stbB50q6nqaeiqcButMisZLChlprAbr%2FUnJqeq6Obwq15wJyroqaXYrCivsSeqWZwYWV%2Fdn6OeKmenm2qvbTA0ZqarWaTpLo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./xomg-pop-holds-auditions-after-four-members-leave-the-group.html><span>←</span><span>XOMG POP!
