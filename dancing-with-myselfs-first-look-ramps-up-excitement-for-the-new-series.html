Dancing With Myself premieres on the network on May 31, following the premiere of <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a>.</strong></p><p>This first look video prepares fans for tons of dancing, laughs, and tons of talent. It unveils the set of dancers picked for the competition, normal people. The first look featured a jiu jitsu instructor, students, teachers, construction workers, and more.</p><p>“People who are usually watching the television or are clearing their furniture out of the living room to dance in front of the television are now on television,” Liza Koshy said.</p><p>The point of the series is that any person is to show off the fun in learning a new dance. Even though many of the on stage dancers are tearing up the floor, it doesn’t seem like they’ve had formal dance training.</p><p>Since this series is all about learning a dance, judges are looking for the dancers to be fresh, fierce, fun, and fantastic. The first look portrays that the competition is more about having fun than it is about getting each step perfect.</p><p>The idea of this series is a lot of fun, so it’s no surprise that the first look makes this series seem like a lot of fun. I’m excited to see each of the judges and contestants tear up the dance floor this summer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dancing-with-myself-premieres-on-may-31>Dancing With Myself Premieres on May 31</h2><p>Shakira has shared that the idea for this series came from seeing people share TikTok dances during the pandemic. Since anyone can do the online routines, she wanted to create a competition for those people. Shakira and Nick Jonas have expressed that this series allows contestants to express themselves through the art form.</p><p>Each week of the competition, dancers will learn a series of high-energy dance challenges. These challenges were designed and demonstrated by the celebrity judges and their friends. The contestants are then placed into pods where they learn the routine and add their own flare. Once the dance is perfected, they will perform their hearts out in front of the live audience. Dancers receive notes from judges, but ultimately the audience picks the night’s winner. The winner goes home with a cash prize.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jon-Courtenay-BGT-Jon-Courtenay-Skin-Cancer.png alt="‘Britain’s Got Talent’ Winner Jon Courtenay Returns to The Stage With Fun Original Song" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlnKGenHq4tdOhZKaxo5q5p7%2BMn6Crq6RiubC7ymapmqWgqHq2vIyer5yhpJq6prrTZp2oql2ptaZ5zZ6uZquVp7amv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-idol-star-phillip-phillips-unveils-highly-anticipated-album-drift-back.html><span>←</span><span>'American Idol' Star Phillip Phillips Unveils Highly Anticipated Album, 'Drift Back'</span></a>
