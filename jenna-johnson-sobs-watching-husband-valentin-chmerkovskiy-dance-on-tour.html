The <a href=# class=broken_link>Dancing with the Stars</a> pro admitted to sobbing while watching her husband perform in the <a href=#>Maks & Val: Stripped Down Tour</a>. The intimate dance show is full of funny moments, meaningful dances, and the Chmerkovskiy brothers literally stripping down to their underwear.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenna-johnson-sheds-tears-watching-maks-val-stripped-down-tour>Jenna Johnson Sheds Tears Watching ‘Maks & Val: Stripped Down Tour’</h2><p>Jenna shared an Instagram post posing with Val after the show. The post also includes a video of Maks and Val taking a bow as the audience gives them a standing ovation. This is the first time in three years that Jenna has gotten to be an audience member at one of Val’s shows.</p><p>“The minute the show started, I sat there in complete awe,” she said. “I was glued to my seat and there were moments that I felt like I had been transported. I laughed, I cried, I blushed and covered my eyes, and then I sobbed again.”</p><p>Jenna wasn’t the only one who had such an emotional reaction during certain points in the show. Maks and Val both shared DM’s that they received from audience members. One audience member said she has never cried so much during a show. Another said that her mother even shed tears during the show.</p><p>“At one point I had to remind myself to breathe because I was completely captivated by the moment,” Jenna said. “Never have I seen you in this form of ARTISTRY. I have always been your number one fan but last night you took my breathe away with your dancing, your ACTING, your comedic timing, your presence, your story telling, and everything in between.”</p><p>She also gave a shoutout to Alexis Warr Burton and JJ Rabone who are Maks and Val’s dance partners. Fans were hoping to see Jenna dance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the tour</a> like she has in the past. The Season 26 Dancing with the Stars champion is most likely preparing for the new season. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 30</a> will premiere on September 20 on ABC.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-chmerkovskiy-brothers-literally-strip-down-to-their-underwear-on-stage>The Chmerkovskiy Brothers Literally Strip Down to Their Underwear on Stage</h2><p>It’s interesting that a show that can make people cry also features Maks and Val removing their clothes. Maks & Val: Stripped Down Tour is a pretty appropriate tour name after all. In one dance, Maks and Val get help from their partners to help put their pants back on. In the process, Maks takes the little towel that was covering his privates and throws it into the crowd.</p><p>Pulling off quick-changes on stage is something we have only ever seen on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a>. Their dedication to the routine is pretty impressive. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another part of the show</a>, Val entertains the crowd while Maks takes his pants off in the background.</p><p>“Some things got lost in translation,” Val captioned the video with a laughing emoji.</p><p>Maks & Val: Stripped Down Tour is halfway through. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Tickets are still available</a> for all of the remaining dates. Do not miss your chance to see the sexy brothers take it all off!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Whats-Hot-11.jpg alt="We Ranked the Top 10 Best Filipino Acts, Do You Agree With Our Top Choice?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>maksim chmerkovskiy</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6lp5ldn7yputKopWarn5fAbsPArZqhoZ6ceqnB0puYp5xdq66tsc2toKdlk526pr7KqK2so5mueqWtzZycZqeeYsGwwdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-flume-musician-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Flume (Musician) Make?
