The remaining 50% say they never do.</p><p data-block-key=a6g12>These figures represent a significant increase since early December 2021* when 43% of workers said they do so. Most of this change is in the “WFH some of the time” category, which has risen ten points from 23%.</p><p data-block-key=7ofn6>Asked what their preferred working situation would be, 29% of workers would prefer work to work from home the whole time, while 43% say some of the time, and only 21% never want to work from home.</p><p data-block-key=f13n5>This represents a significant shift in preferences towards working from home since late 2021, with only half as many Britons now saying they never want to work from home.</p><p data-block-key=6nmfc>There is only limited appetite among workers to work from home less than they currently do. Among those who work from home the whole time currently, only 15% want to switch to only working from home some of the time, and just 1% want to revert to the workplace the whole time.</p><p data-block-key=6sgjp>Likewise, among those working from home some of the time, just 2% want to give that up entirely to spend all their time in the workplace, compared to 25% who would rather switch to working from home the entire time.</p><p data-block-key=24qs3>By contrast, only 40% of those who never work from home are happy with that arrangement.
