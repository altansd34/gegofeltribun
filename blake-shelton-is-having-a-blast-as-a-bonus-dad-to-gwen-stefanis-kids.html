When she began dating Blake Shelton in 2015, the kids became a huge part of his life too. Blake recently gushed about becoming a stepfather to Gwen’s kids after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he proposed to her in October.</a></strong></p><p>The country superstar <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke on the KFROG radio show “The Ride with Kimo & Heather”</a> about his daddy duties. You can listen to the full radio interview <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>Blake Shelton speaks in an interview about becoming a stepfather.</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-shelton-loves-being-a-stepfather-to-gwen-stefani-s-kids>Blake Shelton Loves Being A Stepfather To Gwen Stefani’s Kids</h2><p>“There’s definitely nothing easy about it. I don’t know if it’s as hard or harder or not as hard as being an actual, biological parent, you know? I have a stepfather in my life who is one of my heroes,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake said in the interview about fatherhood.</a> “I love my stepfather and he’s like a father to me, so I have a good inspiration in my life on how to do this and the kind of stepdad I want to be.”</p><p>Blake’s biological father Dick Shelton <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">passed away in 2012.</a> Blake canceled tour dates during this time to be there for his family. His mother Dorothy is married to Mike Shackleford, Blake’s stepdad.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9IxKbZn6h9/</p>@gwenstefani/Instagram.com</figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>GWEN STEFANI SUMS UP BLAKE SHELTON’S DADDY SKILLS IN 8 PHOTOS</a></strong></p><p>“I take it very serious, but I also have a blast with it,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he said during the interview.</a> “I don’t take it so serious that I’m not enjoying this time because I really am, especially now that we’re five years into this thing. I can’t imagine my life without these kids now.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gwen-gushed-about-blake-s-daddy-skills-in-the-past>Gwen Gushed About Blake’s Daddy Skills In The Past</h3><p>During an appearance on The Today Show in 2019, Gwen gushed about Blake’s parenting skills. “He is a good dad, actually,” she said. “He’s been helping me out a lot. I literally get to the point where I’m like, ‘You gotta get home—I need help!’ It’s hard. I got three boys.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>Gwen Stefani talks about how great of a stepfather Blake Shelton is.</figure><p>But Blake has had to find the perfect balance of being a parent and a friend to Gwen’s sons. “That’s a scary moment for me because it’s one thing for me to be with the kids all the time and be their buddy, but you do have to consider after a while that they start to listen to things that you say. There’s a lot of responsibility that comes with that,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake said in an interview.</a></p><p>We cannot wait to see Blake and Gwen walk down the aisle. Gwen’s kids <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“will have a large part” in the wedding</a> between the two ‘Voice’ coaches. “Gwen’s sons are really solid, sweet kids, and they’re so excited for Blake and Gwen to get married,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a friend close to the couple told People.</a>&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-also-spoke-about-his-hilarious-super-bowl-ad-with-his-future-wife>Blake Also Spoke About His Hilarious Super Bowl Ad With His Future Wife</h3><p>The best part of the Super Bowl was seeing Blake and Gwen star in a hilarious commercial with their fellow ‘Voice’ coach Adam Levine. Though the commercial was a parody of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their relationship</a> that proves opposites attract, Blake is still enamored that he is engaged to Gwen.</p><p>“People to this day—and I’m one of them, by the way—just&nbsp;can’t wrap their head around the fact&nbsp;that Gwen Stefani is my girlfriend, now my fiancé,” the “God’s Country,” singer said during the radio interview. “It is ridiculous. I admit that…I will admit it. I don’t know what she’s thinking.”</p><p>Blake doesn’t give himself enough credit. On top of winning The Voice seven times and having a plethora of smash hit songs, he is an awesome stepdad and future husband. Check out the video below to find out more on how Blake became such a huge superstar.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SUPER BOWL AD: BLAKE SHELTON AND GWEN STEFANI FELL IN LOVE BASED ON A MISTAKE BY ADAM LEVINE</a></strong></p><p>And if you were wondering if Blake honored his<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> pledge to lose 10 pounds</a> before his wedding to Gwen, the answer is “oh God no.” Blake will be returning to Season 20 of The Voice with social distancing measures this March. He called it “weird” thinking about the fact that a live studio audience may be back in the arena someday. But for now, the show will continue on honoring safety protocols amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bruno-Mars.png alt="How Bruno Mars Impersonator Scammed A Texas Woman Out Of $100,000" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>blake shelton</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Gwen Stefani</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWaho2K1osLIp55mmV2XuaK%2F02aYrGWRYq%2BwutSsZJ2ZlGLBsHnGsJynZaOpsqetzaKqZqOZmcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./at-65-michelle-pfeiffer-shares-makeup-free-selfie-and-leaves-fans-in-awe-818233.html><span>←</span><span>At 65, Michelle Pfeiffer Shares Makeup-Free Selfie and Leaves Fans in Awe</span></a>
