She is a 21-time Grammy winner who completely slays every single album she puts out. But, just like the rest of us, Beyonce likes to dabble in the art of photoshop. Check out five of her biggest photoshop fails that had us shaking our heads</strong>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beyonce Looked Gorgeous At The Premiere Of ‘The Lion King’</h2><p>Beyonce voiced the character Nala in Disney’s 2019 live-action ‘Lion King’ remake. She dazzled in a mustard yellow gown that hugged her waist. She posted the following photos below from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">premiere of the movie.</a> But, look a little closer at the second and fourth pictures. The ledge that is behind her in the pictures is completely slanted. Everyone knows that a ledge is supposed to be straight, so fans think that she photoshopped the picture to make her waist look smaller and her hips wider. Beyonce already has a snatched waist and an amazing body so she definitely does not need to alter her photos to change that.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0CTgJcnATI/?utm_source=ig_embed</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>JAY-Z AND BEYONCE’S DAUGHTER BLUE IVY FOUND THE CURE FOR CORONAVIRUS [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>She Had Some Editing Fun On The Golf Course</h3><p>Ok, this is more of an obvious photoshop fail. Back in 2014, the singer showed off her golfing skills while on a family vacation. But, you can obviously see that her right thigh is very warped in the photo. Both of her thighs clearly have some pixelation around them. She likely photoshopped her thighs to make them look slimmer or to give the illusion that she has a thigh gap. Is anyone else wondering why she obviously photoshopped this picture and hasn’t taken the post down?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/mnbJOZvw_Z/?utm_source=ig_embed</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Beyonce Wore A Figure-Hugging Bodysuit</h3><p>We will admit that she looks absolutely amazing in this photo. However, if you look at the curtains on the right side of the photo, they appear to be slanted or warped. Normally, curtains just fall straight down and are vertical. This draws attention to her waist which fans seem to think she photoshopped. It raises several questions about body image and why exactly she has photoshopped these photos. But honestly, as one of the most famous celebrities in the entire world, she is definitely under a lot of pressure from people to look perfect all the time. It’s such a sad reality that women go through this just to appeal to others or because of insecurities that the media has caused them. It’s one of those pictures where the more you stare at it, the more obvious the editing becomes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading>She Posed On An Interesting Staircase</h3><p>Before we even talk about the photoshop blunder, can we talk about how amazing she looks in this snakeskin bikini? Beyonce is literally living her best life in the photo. If you take a look at the sixth step from the bottom of the staircase, you can see that it is distorted. The step looks as if it is crooked. Everyone knows that steps are straight, and if they’re not, you might want to go consult with a carpenter. But in all seriousness, this is another case of Beyonce using photoshop to create the illusion that she has a thigh gap. Whether she has a minor obsession with having a thigh gap or not, this photoshop fail is pretty obvious. And let’s reiterate yet again that she absolutely does not need to use photoshop to alter her pictures because she is truly beautiful inside and out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Samantha-small.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Beyonce’s Wine Glass Looks A Little…Weird</h3><p>The singer enjoyed a nice glass of wine <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>during a vacation in 2014.</a> Pay close attention to the wine glass in the bottom right corner of the photo. It definitely looks a little strange. Wine glasses are typically symmetrical on both sides and this one is definitely not. Again, it looks like Beyonce photoshopped her thighs in this picture. Perhaps she was trying to make them look a little bit slimmer or something along those lines. It just raises further questions about why she felt the need to edit the picture in the first place. Not to mention her iPhone is completely warped and slanted in this photo. Everyone knows that iPhones are perfectly rectangular so this obvious detail points to photoshop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/beyonce-photoshop-fails-.jpeg><p>Celebrities are often under a microscope for every single thing that goes on in their lives. It is natural to want to look your best if you are constantly in the spotlight. It is not natural however to edit or alter your pictures to change what you actually look like. People need to accept and love themselves and how they look.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>WATCH BEYONCE’S ENTIRE “WISHING ON A STAR” PERFORMANCE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS TAKING CARE OF US ALL</a></strong></p><p>Body confidence is such an important issue that needs more people talking about it.
