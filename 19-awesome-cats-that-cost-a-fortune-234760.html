They can be&nbsp;hairless and furry, wayward and friendly, or&nbsp;tender and freedom-loving. They’re stunning and are a&nbsp;never-ending source of&nbsp;fascination and curiosity to&nbsp;those who cherish their companionship.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the International Cat Association (TICA), there are 73&nbsp;cat breeds officially recognized, and we&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> picked some examples of&nbsp;the most exciting ones to&nbsp;tell our readers about. So&nbsp;follow&nbsp;us on&nbsp;this gentle journey to&nbsp;cherish cats’ unique and special qualities.</p><p><h2>Norwegian Forest cat</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/20b/ab7/345f7450d99e7c671029e025df.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Norwegian Forest</a> cat can stand to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;icy areas because it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;beautiful, long furry coat. This breed almost went extinct during the mid-twentieth century, but a&nbsp;breeding program decided to&nbsp;make more of&nbsp;them, increasing their numbers. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, this big and strong cat is&nbsp;trendy in&nbsp;Norway, Sweden, and France. It&nbsp;has long legs and can live up&nbsp;to&nbsp;16&nbsp;years.</p><p>However, if&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;get this breed, try to&nbsp;watch out for kidney and heart problems they may have, as&nbsp;these issues have become common in&nbsp;this type of&nbsp;breed.</p><p><h2>Himalayan cat</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b1/f8c/facbf3538d880eb57817708190.jpg><p>This breed is&nbsp;named the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Colorpoint Persian</a> as&nbsp;well and looks much like a&nbsp;Persian cat, but it’s characterized by&nbsp;blue eyes and colorpoint coloring (a&nbsp;light body and a&nbsp;dark face, feet, ears, and tail). Its body is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit round with short legs, making it&nbsp;more difficult for them to&nbsp;jump as&nbsp;high as&nbsp;other cats can. There are 2&nbsp;types of&nbsp;this cat&nbsp;— the doll-face and peke-faced (these tend to&nbsp;have more squished-looking faces). Himalayan cats appeared in&nbsp;1950 in&nbsp;the US.</p><p>Himalayans are tender, obedient, and friendly cats with a&nbsp;calm temperament. Their fur is&nbsp;usually white, but they can come in&nbsp;many colors, such as&nbsp;black, blue, lilac, chocolate, and red. The hardest ones to&nbsp;produce are the chocolate and lilac ones because the parents must carry this color gene, and since it’s a&nbsp;recessive trait, it’s more difficult.</p><p><h2>Scottish Fold</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a52/228/af5b7e51baa66d6d597cfd45fb.jpg><p>The most recognizable detail found on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Scottish Folds</a> is&nbsp;cute ears that, unlike other cats, don’t stick up&nbsp;— they hang. This unusual feature is&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;genetic mutation. These cats are extremely clever. They get along easily with other family members and are always ready to&nbsp;play. One more distinctive feature of&nbsp;Scottish Folds is&nbsp;that they can stand on&nbsp;their hind legs and observe things they’re interested&nbsp;in.</p><p><h2>Peterbald</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cff/e5a/dfd3b45ef8bde42acf21553904.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Peterbalds</a>, also known as&nbsp;the Petersburg Sphynx, are elegant cats&nbsp;— they have slim bodies, elongated heads, and large extended ears. The body can be&nbsp;bald or&nbsp;fuzzy. Peterbalds are sociable, tender-tempered, and easy to&nbsp;train. These cats can be&nbsp;born bald, brushed, or&nbsp;with a&nbsp;straight coat. But those born with fur can lose it&nbsp;after some time, and they can come in&nbsp;all sorts of&nbsp;colors.</p><p>Their personality varies&nbsp;— it&nbsp;is&nbsp;sweet-tempered, affectionate, peaceful, curious, smart, and energetic. They like being around their owners and spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time with them. They generally don’t have problems living with other pets and tend to&nbsp;get along with children quite nicely.</p><p><h2>Egyptian Mau</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b98/0b6/ad43725c72a67221ce55ad9f0a.jpg><p>The appearance of&nbsp;these cats has changed very little over the last 3,000 years&nbsp;— since their emergence in&nbsp;Ancient Egypt. These cats have not only a&nbsp;spotted coat but also spotted skin. The cat is&nbsp;somewhat muscular, and its back legs are longer than the front, making it&nbsp;look tip-toed when standing upright. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the fastest breed compared to&nbsp;other domestic cats and has a&nbsp;long and dark stripe that goes from the head to&nbsp;its tail.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Egyptian Mau</a> cats appear in&nbsp;4&nbsp;colors&nbsp;— silver, bronze, black, and blue. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;personality, they are very loyal, playful, and friendly&nbsp;— and they love warm temperatures. They wiggle their tails to&nbsp;mark their territory and also love to&nbsp;sing&nbsp;— their odd voices sound like bird chirps. The breed’s eye color can even change depending on&nbsp;how they feel (between green and bluish).</p><p><h2>Maine Coon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/007/78e/b16b4a5aac86141c3c5caf07ae.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Maine Coon</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the largest cat breeds. Its can weigh anywhere from 11&nbsp;lb to&nbsp;33&nbsp;lb (5&nbsp;kg to&nbsp;15&nbsp;kg), and a&nbsp;mature cat’s body can reach 4&nbsp;ft (1.23&nbsp;m) in&nbsp;length. However, despite their fearsome appearance, these are affectionate, gentle, and playful animals.</p><p><h2>LaPerm</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9b/a43/355197589d907c9f12020767c4.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most unusual breeds, and it&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;the 1980s in&nbsp;the US. Thanks to&nbsp;their curly hair, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>LaPerm</a> cats don’t shed very much, so&nbsp;they can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good breed for cat parents with respiratory allergies.</p><p><h2>Archangel Blue</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fca/43e/46e74f52ebb013dd12be93b562.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most popular shorthair cat breeds. It&nbsp;became known worldwide in&nbsp;the late nineteenth century. This cat has green eyes and is&nbsp;only one color, which is&nbsp;blue. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;double coat&nbsp;— very thick and soft to&nbsp;the touch&nbsp;— and its tail has stripes, but they often aren’t seen well because they’re dull-colored. They are quite a&nbsp;curious, friendly, smart, and reserved breed.</p><p>They are known for playing fetch and opening doors and are very sensitive to&nbsp;people’s emotions. These cats are super loyal to&nbsp;their owners and other household pets. Although they can shy away from strangers and be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;reserved, they’re quite the hunters. They can get bored easily, so&nbsp;they need toys and playmates.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Archangel Blues</a> have a&nbsp;great memory, and they may even hide their toys somewhere in&nbsp;the house and then lead their owners to&nbsp;that hiding place if&nbsp;they want to&nbsp;play. They remember faces and can even greet familiar ones after a&nbsp;long time of&nbsp;not seeing them.</p><p><h2>Toyger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b89/2e7/f08ea15987ba18a90204dd627a.jpg><p>This large cat breed resembles a&nbsp;tiger with its coat pattern, and it&nbsp;explains the name’s origin. The breed’s founder states that the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Toyger</a> was developed to&nbsp;inspire people to&nbsp;think about tiger preservation in&nbsp;the wild.</p><p><h2>American Curl</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a7c/ca2/0417c55086bf1948ab2c3e61b5.jpg><p>This breed was developed in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US in&nbsp;the 1980s. The newborn kittens can hardly be&nbsp;distinguished from full-grown cats, but as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;their tenth day of&nbsp;life, their ears start turning back, like little horns. This specific feature from the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>American Curl</a> touches the hearts of&nbsp;many people around the world.</p><p><h2>Bengal cat</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b2a/3e6/c275ec5cdebca0410f94d00e3e.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bengals</a> are a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cross between an&nbsp;Asian leopard сat and a&nbsp;domestic cat. These cats love to&nbsp;swim and, despite their impressive size (8.8&nbsp;lb to&nbsp;17.6&nbsp;lb), they often climb their owners’ shoulders.</p><p><h2>Khaomanee</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b02/f09/ce4b6751b2badbafa5280c54f8.jpg><p>We&nbsp;can find the earliest references to&nbsp;this breed in&nbsp;Tamra Maew, or&nbsp;<i>Cat Book Poems</i> (1350-1767). In&nbsp;ancient Siam, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Khaomanees</a> lived only with the royal families and were considered a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;luck, longevity, and wealth. They are a&nbsp;curious breed, loyal, and smart. They love to&nbsp;play fetch just before napping with you in&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm bed.</p><p><h2>Chausie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dcf/795/b8498b5fd48185bc91244129d2.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the rarest cat breeds. It&nbsp;was developed by&nbsp;crossing a&nbsp;domestic cat with a&nbsp;jungle cat. These are very sociable animals, and it’s hard for them to&nbsp;bear loneliness. But, on&nbsp;the other hand, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chausies</a> will be&nbsp;happy with any company, whether it&nbsp;be&nbsp;human, feline, or&nbsp;even canine.</p><p><h2>Savannah cat</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/413/5dd/7119405d0594859792d4cc6cf1.jpg><p>This breed was developed by&nbsp;crossing an&nbsp;African Serval with a&nbsp;domestic cat. They’re the largest cats: a&nbsp;mature cat weighs an&nbsp;average of&nbsp;33&nbsp;lb and reaches 1.9 feet in&nbsp;height. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Savannah</a> cats are known for their high level of&nbsp;intelligence, calm temperament, curiosity, and playful nature. They love taking baths, walking outdoors, and playing games. But to&nbsp;own such a&nbsp;wonderful cat, you need to&nbsp;have lots of&nbsp;space for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;play.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you happen to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;rare cat as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pet?
