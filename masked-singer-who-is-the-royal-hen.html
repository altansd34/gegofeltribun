It’s also been posted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here to Twitter</a>. Royal Hen said, “I’m not only known in America, but because of what I did, I’m known around the world.” She’s holding up a Masked Singer News newspaper that says “Royal Hen Cracks Eggspectations & Takes the World By Storm.”</p><p>As Royal Hen walked out on Elton John Night, the judges mentioned that she appeared to be a little older. Then, the clues started with her coronation. The announcer says she’s “set to hold court” and a “true trailblazer.” She is famous for championing equal opportunities for all, and has made it her mission to be a voice for the voiceless. We see a platter with a football on it.</p><p>A bear walks up to the Royal Hen as the announcer explains that “her road to stardom was wrought with prejudice…[and she] entered the ring bravely and proved to her 90 million subjects that she was worthy of the crown.” She defeats the bear by hitting it with the platter, then receives the “royal stadium hot dog.” Royal Hen walks up to the window, where the Eiffel Tower is visible. The announcer mentions her name is “etched in history” to close out the clues. Then, the Men in Black bring out a medal on a heart and Royal Hen describes, “This is when I won the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama!”</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO’S PERFORMING ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Royal Hen</h2><p>Robin thinks about the Presidential Medal of Freedom and predicts it’s her dad’s ex-girlfriend, Gloria Steinem. But Jenny went more of a sports route, guessing it could be someone from 80 for Brady like Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Sally Field, or maybe even Rita Moreno. Ken predicted Billie Jean King, because she sang “Philadelphia Freedom” and Elton John wrote that song with her in mind. Fans online were pretty convinced that this was BIllie Jean King from her voice and the clues that all seemed to point to her, shockingly agreeing with Ken Jeong.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Royal Hen on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>After the first performance, it became clear who the Royal Hen was. Her voice is just so distinct and the clues line up perfectly! The Royal Hen is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-jean-king>Billie Jean King!</h3><p>So the Internet was right once again, but we love to see it. And she was honestly so good! Ken nailed the clues too, from the tennis references to her winning the French Open, to her being a trailblazer and advocate for women. Plus, she got the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Obama AND “Philadelphia Freedom” was really written with her in mind.
