The groom might add a heavy Agbada with lots of embroidery on top of his native shirt and trousers.</p><p class=align-left>Igbo men also wear an Isiagu or a plain white shirt that reaches the knees. Isiagu is a pullover shirt, usually embroidered with lion heads, crowns or other large symbols.</p><p class=align-left>Some grooms like wearing simple trousers that are traditionally wide-legged, while others, however, go for the wrapper, which can be as short or as long as they want.
