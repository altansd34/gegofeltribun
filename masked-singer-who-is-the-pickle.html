He joined Group A as the first wildcard of the season! And first, we got this <a href=#>Instagram video with clues about the Pickle</a>. His clues included a joker card, him doing graffiti, a podcast microphone, and Martin Scorsese.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO’S PERFORMING ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE?</a></strong></p><p>Then when it came time for NFL Night, we got even more clues about the Pickle’s hidden identity. The Pickle “never imagined himself” here and a Joker card was shown, as the Pickle spray painted graffiti on a chalkboard. He claims that as a kid, he was a “hyper disruptive kid who had no interest in anything but sports.” A podcast microphone was shown on a desk.</p><p>Once he found his true passion, he became laser focused. He’s rubbed elbows with “some of the most famous people on Earth,” including Quinten Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Martin Short. His mouth still gets him beef, and he describes himself as a “hyper disruptive adult.” After his performance, we saw an “On Air” sign and the Pickle explained, “When I speak, people listen.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Pickle</h2><p>The judges thought that the Pickle could be Craig Kilborn, Dax Shepard, Conan O’Brien, or Howard Stern. Fans were going wild in the comments trying to guess the celebrity. Initial popular predictions included Joaquin Phoenix, Neil Patrick Harris, one of the guys from Impractical Jokers, Pete Davidson, Tobey Maguire, and Jim Carrey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Pickle on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>With that voice and all the clues, we can confidently make our prediction that the Pickle is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michael-rapaport>Michael Rapaport!</h3><p>And here is a rundown of all his clues. The Joker card is obviously pointing to the fact that he’s a comedian. Then, he mentioned being a “hyper disruptive kid” and Michael was actually expelled from his school growing up. The podcast mic definitely makes sense, because he hosts the I Am Rapaport Stereo Podcast. That also explains the “On Air” sign and him saying that when he talks, “people listen.”</p><p>The judges mentioned that the Pickle is tall and Michael Rapaport is 6’2″. Finally, we’ll go through his connections with Quinten Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Martin Short. Michael appeared in the Tarantino movie True Romance. He has interviewed Scorsese on his podcast. And lastly, Michael Rapaport appeared in season two of Only Murders in the Building, starring Martin Short.</p><p>But only time will tell if we’re right! Stay tuned for The Masked Singer, Wednesdays on FOX, for the Pickle’s return next week.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_NicoleScherzinger_Victor-BoykoGetty-Images-for-Magnum-220x147.jpg alt="Nicole Scherzinger Details The Harsh Reality of Ageism in Hollywood ‘It Is a Tragedy’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZaCesKy4xGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1589348-who-andrew-santinos-wife-learn-comedians-background.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Andrew Santino's wife?
