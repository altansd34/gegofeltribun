Only one in five Britons (19%) have a positive opinion of the prime minister, compared to 75% who have a negative view. This gives him a net favourability score of -56 – equal to that we found last week, which represented a new record low for the prime minister.</p><p data-block-key=ffeug>In fact, survey data conducted in between this week’s weekly update and last week’s found Sunak had slipped fractionally to an even lower ebb of -57.</p><p data-block-key=fr3qv>Attitudes towards the Conservative party are identical to those towards its leader (-56), which represents the lowest score for the party since YouGov started favourability tracking in 2016.</p><p data-block-key=f72k>Only 43% of those who backed the party in 2019 still have a favourable view of the Tories, compared to 53% with an unfavourable opinion, giving a net score of -10.</p><p data-block-key=cfv7q>Labour leader Keir Starmer continues to be significantly more popular (or less unpopular) than his Tory counterpart. More than one in three Britons (36%) have a favourable view of Starmer, although a majority still have an unfavourable view (56%).</p><p data-block-key=6cfr0>The Labour party is slightly more popular than its leader: 40% have a positive view compared to 52% with a negative one.</p><p data-block-key=6e4bm>Nigel Farage is the party leader with the second highest favourability score, at 27%, followed by Lib Dem leader Ed Davey on 26% - although Farage is unpopular with far more (66% vs 34%). Four in ten Britons answer “don’t know” with respect to Davey – <a href=#>a recent YouGov poll showed that most Britons couldn’t recognise him when shown his picture, including a third of Lib Dem voters</a>.</p><p data-block-key=1ltav>The Green leaders are largely unknown – only 11% and 6% respectively have favourable views of Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, while 71-78% answer “don’t know”.</p><p data-block-key=9saia>The Green party itself is much more well known – and regarded. Four in ten Britons (41%) have a positive view of the Greens, equal to the number with an unfavourable view, making it the most popular national party, albeit with a net favourability score of zero.</p><p data-block-key=5shel>Almost as many have a positive opinion of the Lib Dems (39%), while 27% have a favourable view of Reform UK, making them more popular than their Tory rivals, although still unpopular overall (61% have a negative view).</p><p data-block-key=aavj8><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=dosqk>What do you think about the party leaders, the election campaign in general, and everything else?
