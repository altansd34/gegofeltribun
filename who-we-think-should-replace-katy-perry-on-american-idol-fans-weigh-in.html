Now that she’s officially retired from the position, we asked our fans who they thought should replace Perry. Here’s all the responses we’ve gathered.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-should-replace-katy-perry-on-american-idol>Who Should Replace Katy Perry on American Idol?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-kelly-clarkson>1. Kelly Clarkson</h3><p>Who would be better than the OG American Idol winner herself, Kelly Clarkson? The talk show host/singer knows how the show works better than anyone else since she’s been through it herself. It wouldn’t be completely out of character for her to take over this role, since she was a coach on The Voice for eight seasons.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-jelly-roll>2. Jelly Roll</h3><p>Fans are dying to see Jelly Roll return to American Idol in a full time position. Jelly Roll appeared on American Idol season 22 in Hawaii Week. Fans quickly became obsessed with this singer on the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>noting</a> that he “screams positivity and entertaining to say the least.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-meghan-trainor>3. Meghan Trainor</h3><p>Pop sensation Meghan Trainor would be a fantastic pick as Katy Perry’s replacement. Trainor has experience as a mentor on American Idol, judge on Australian Idol, and coach on The Voice UK. This would be the most even replacement for Perry, since the artists are within the same genre.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-simon-cowell>4. Simon Cowell</h3><p>Fans have made it very very clear that they would love to see one or more of the original American Idol judges back. When looking into fans’ opinion on who should return to the show, it was clear many wish to see the America’s Got Talent judge back on American Idol.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-taylor-swift>5. Taylor Swift</h3><p>Some fans are really hoping to see a new, yet known face on the judging panel. It’s no secret that Taylor Swift has truly become one of the biggest names within the pop genre. That being said, it’s possible that Swift wouldn’t be able to take on such a big task, since she’s extremely busy.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-adam-lambert>6. Adam Lambert</h3><p>Once again, American Idol fans want to see another former American Idol star on the judging panel. Adam Lambert is right next to Kelly Clarkson on the list of most successful American Idol finalists. Since the show, Lambert has gone on to take over for Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. Lambert has also appeared as a judge on both The Voice Australia and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clash of the Cover Bands</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-sara-bareilles>7. Sara Bareilles</h3><p>Grammy Award winner Sara Bareilles is another fan pick to replace Katy Perry on American Idol. This popular singer has not only been successful on the music charts, she’s also been nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards and three Tony Awards. This also wouldn’t be Bareilles’ first judging role, since she had been a judge on the show The Sing-Off.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-jon-bon-jovi>8. Jon Bon Jovi</h3><p>I won’t lie, the idea of Jon Bon Jovi returning to the American Idol stage full time is quite exciting. This music legend would be interesting to have on the panel full time. He would be a great judge alongside Lionel Richie, since they both have decades long careers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-tori-kelly>9. Tori Kelly</h3><p>Tori Kelly is another American Idol alumni that fans would love to see return to the show. Like Jelly Roll, Tori Kelly appeared as a mentor during Season 22’s Hawaii Week. In her case, this was a bit of a full circle moment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-fantasia>10. Fantasia</h3><p>Finally, fans are hoping to see Fantasia return to American Idol full time. After Fantasia’s recent mainstream success in The Color Purple, fans were shocked to see her return to the American Idol stage for Season 22’s finale. Given the success of The Color Purple, there’s a big possibility that Fantasia already has something else lined up in the near future.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_MorganWallen_Sara-KaussFilmMagic-220x147.jpg alt="Nashville City Council Rejects Sign for Morgan Wallen’s New Bar" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>katy perry</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZq%2BVYsGptc2kZKygn6q5pXnRnqelmZOaeqyt07JkqZ2ip8Zuu81mmKadop6worqMopuopF2brq%2B%2FjLCcop%2BYYravew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1578942-who-mark-laitas-wife-know.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Mark Laita's wife?
