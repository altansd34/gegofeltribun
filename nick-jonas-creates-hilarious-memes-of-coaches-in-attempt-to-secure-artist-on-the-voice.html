Her performance is so good that the coaches literally start <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an all-out battle</a> to get her on their teams. Nick Jonas tries to convince Anna that Blake Shelton hates puppies through a presentation of memes. Will Nick’s tactic work?</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1CDLAbHIu4</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-anna-grace-has-four-chair-turn-on-the-voice-with-billie-eilish-cover>Anna Grace Has Four Chair Turn On ‘The Voice’ With Billie Eilish Cover</h2><p>Anna Grace starts off the song with her gorgeous tone and the coaches are thoroughly impressed. About 20 seconds into the performance, John Legend, Kelly Clarkson and Nick all turn their chairs at the same time. During the very last few lines of the song, Blake shocks everyone by turning his chair.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Music means a lot to Anna</a> because it has gotten her through some very hard times. “I love all of the nuances that you showed and you made such cool choices musically,” John says about the performance. “It was really really beautiful.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>‘THE VOICE’ COACHES CLAP BACK AT BLAKE SHELTON FOR ACCUSING THEM OF BEING ‘HOLLYWOOD’</a></strong></p><p>“I love that song,” Kelly says. “It just sounds kind of ethereal and you get to use your head voice a lot and as a female I love it. It’s just a really cool contemporary take on an old-school vibe.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCoaRSsg8DI/</p></figure><p>“Well, I love your voice. I was already thinking of several songs that would be cool to take that approach on” Kelly continues. “I’m going to go ahead and start coaching you as if you did pick me. Because there were points, and I think it’s just breath control, where you got a little shaky with pitch. Even with the shaky parts, it was so intimate and believable.”</p><p>“I thought you did a really good job of walking the line between the way Billie Eilish approaches her vocals and also being certain that we’re aware of your range and the strength of your voice” Blake adds. He then construes a lie and says that Nick turned to him during the performance to say Anna would sound great doing a country song.</p><p>“I think it’s important to keep your eye on the ball and know who you are and not be distracted by the wrong coach,” Blake says pointing to Nick. The other coaches proceed to call him out for spinning this web of lies.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAx8irdA-au/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-makes-an-inappropriate-pitch-to-anna-after-the-performance>Nick Makes An ‘Inappropriate’ Pitch To Anna After The Performance</h3><p>It is then Nick’s turn to give his pitch to Anna to try and convince her to be on his team. “This show is all about great voices obviously and you are one of the best we’ve heard,” he says. Nick then stands up to show Anna something that he found on the internet. He directs everyone’s attention to a screen where he created memes about each of the other coaches. Blake’s meme claims he is a “puppy hater.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“That pitch was seriously inappropriate” John says after Nick’s presentation.
