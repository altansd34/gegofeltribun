He said he would rewind his life back if he could. “I would probably say it was the first time I decided to cheat on Khloe. I would rewind that back and take those things back and never let that happen.” He had written about the downfall of their marriage in his book Darkness To Light: A Memoir.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lamar-also-apologized-for-threatening-to-kill-his-wife>Lamar Also Apologized For Threatening To Kill His Wife</h3><p>In his book, Lamar also apologizes to Khloe for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a drug-fueled night</a> that led to him threatening her. Lamar was high on coke and ecstasy one night and began demonstrating erratic behavior in his man cave. Khloe grew concerned and called some of his friends to help calm him down. Lamar began ripping apart the walls until his hands were bloodied causing Khloe to run into their bedroom to hide. She came back a little while later to try and get him to come out of the room.</p><p>“I opened it suddenly and grabbed her forcefully by the shoulders which frightened her,” he writes in the book. “‘What the f**k are you doing?’ I screamed, out of my mind. ‘You try to embarrass me in front of my friends? I’ll f**king kill you! You don’t know what I’m capable of!’ She ran back upstairs and slammed the door.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> WHO IS THE BLONDE TRISTAN THOMPSON IS CAUGHT HAVING DINNER WITH?
