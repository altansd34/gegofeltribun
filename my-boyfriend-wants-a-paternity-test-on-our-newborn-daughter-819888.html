She finds herself navigating the emotional complexities of&nbsp;trust and doubt as&nbsp;her boyfriend, consumed by&nbsp;uncertainty, requests a&nbsp;paternity test for their newborn daughter. This demand casts a&nbsp;shadow over what should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;joyous time, prompting questions about faith, fidelity, and the fragility of&nbsp;human connections.</p><p>My&nbsp;longtime boyfriend of&nbsp;7.5 years and&nbsp;I just had our newborn daughter almost three weeks ago, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;asking for a&nbsp;paternity test. We&nbsp;met at&nbsp;work. I’m a&nbsp;nurse, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;surgeon, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;very dedicated to&nbsp;his job. So&nbsp;needless to&nbsp;say, he&nbsp;does work a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;currently am&nbsp;not working, so&nbsp;I stay home a&nbsp;lot, and he&nbsp;supports&nbsp;us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c3d/dcd/30f5255931b55e1e94fd8941ca.jpg><p>Throughout our <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>, I&nbsp;have been very faithful to&nbsp;him. He, however, has had a&nbsp;few slip-ups throughout our 7.5&nbsp;years. Which I&nbsp;have forgiven him. He&nbsp;has told his&nbsp;OR staff that he&nbsp;asked for a&nbsp;paternity test, which upset&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;says they understand why&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;upset.</p><p>His rationale is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;doesn’t want to&nbsp;raise a&nbsp;child that he&nbsp;doesn’t know if&nbsp;it’s his 100%. He&nbsp;doesn’t want to&nbsp;find out later on&nbsp;down the road that she’s not his. Like he&nbsp;sees in&nbsp;movies. He&nbsp;just wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/877/13e/9845b95e1a98d9d4d2b3792c2d.jpg><p>But then he&nbsp;goes on&nbsp;to&nbsp;say that I’m home all the time by&nbsp;myself since he’s never home, and he&nbsp;doesn’t know what I&nbsp;do for sure. Which definitely is&nbsp;a&nbsp;slap in&nbsp;the face to&nbsp;me, as&nbsp;I have been the one who has been faithful. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;pay for the paternity test, then I’m fine with that. But am&nbsp;I wrong for being upset by&nbsp;how he’s trying to&nbsp;rationalize it&nbsp;and make me&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;I’m the one who is&nbsp;unfaithful?</p><p><h2>People supported her.</h2></p><ul><li>“IMAX level of&nbsp;projection here. I’d be&nbsp;wondering if&nbsp;he&nbsp;has any other kids out there that need paternity tests. Cheating isn’t a ’slip-up.’” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Fire_or_water_kai&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“I’m a&nbsp;nurse who was married to&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor. He&nbsp;will continue to&nbsp;cheat on&nbsp;you, I&nbsp;promise. He’s projecting on&nbsp;you his own behavior, my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;did that as&nbsp;well. He&nbsp;would call to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;I left work to&nbsp;the minute... forbid me&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;work... it&nbsp;doesn’t get better. Hugs to&nbsp;you.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Comfortable-Wish-192&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“He&nbsp;wants the test because he&nbsp;thinks you’re like him, and you both know you can’t trust him. Give him the test and get it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;the way, but you’re 100% justified in&nbsp;being upset that it’s his own behavior that’s causing this lack of&nbsp;trust.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Fragrant_Spray&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/596/fd9/29107a5c01ad88d94b7d94175e.jpg><ul><li>“He’s projecting because he’s been unfaithful himself. Not sure&nbsp;I could stick around with this relationship. His slip-up(s) probably won’t stop. Just a&nbsp;gut feeling. I&nbsp;wish the best for you, no&nbsp;matter what you decide.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ill-Relationship-890&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“You’re not wrong, but I’m going to&nbsp;give you a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;tough love here. This guy is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;marry you and that’s bad for you. You’ve been together for 7.5&nbsp;years, you’re having a&nbsp;kid together, and you aren’t planning a&nbsp;wedding.<br>Without that <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> certificate, you have no&nbsp;right to&nbsp;any of&nbsp;his assets that will grow while you are home taking care of&nbsp;the house and your kid. Then, when/if he&nbsp;leaves you for one of&nbsp;his side pieces, you will be&nbsp;left with no&nbsp;money, a&nbsp;big gap in&nbsp;employment, and a&nbsp;career that was stunted by&nbsp;the time off.<br>This ’get a&nbsp;paternity test’ thing is&nbsp;something men are discussing on&nbsp;forums where they don’t respect women much. I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;surprised if&nbsp;the advice not to&nbsp;marry you came from the same place. He’s protecting his assets at&nbsp;your expense and not marrying you because it&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;cut and run.<br>For your own sake, take a&nbsp;step back and really look at&nbsp;where your relationship is&nbsp;going. He&nbsp;doesn’t even trust that your kid is&nbsp;his. Without trust, your relationship is&nbsp;built on&nbsp;shifting sands.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Aylauria&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“This is&nbsp;what happens when you have babies with cheaters. They will always think you are doing what they are doing. I&nbsp;would agree to&nbsp;a&nbsp;DNA test and put him on&nbsp;child support and plan your exit strategy.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Disastrous-Sthe&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>In&nbsp;the end, the resolution of&nbsp;the <a href=#>paternity test</a> stands as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pivotal moment in&nbsp;their lives. This experience tests the strength of&nbsp;their relationship, compelling them to&nbsp;confront their insecurities and reaffirm their commitment to&nbsp;each other and their child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnWmqWtq12WerGt056pp6Gkrnq1sdKtZKimXaTCs3nNnq6bp6KjeqWt1KCfrZ2iYoVyhZdxb2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1258165-mickey-rourke-happened-actor-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mickey Rourke then and now: what happened to the actor?</span></a>
