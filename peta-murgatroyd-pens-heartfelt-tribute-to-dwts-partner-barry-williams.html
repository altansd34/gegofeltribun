Williams was chosen by the judges as the dance-off winner, but he was unfortunately eliminated shortly thereafter.</p><p>“I took the morning to fully digest the season I just had,” Murgatroyd wrote in the post’s caption. “To Barry, my Bazza, my Big Bad Baz, the Heart Of The Show! What a surprise you were.”</p><p>Murgatroyd admitted she “grossly underestimated” Williams, who turned 69 years old during the Season 32 competition. She went on to write that this was “one of my favorite seasons ever,” telling Williams, “You showed them that at any age you can still pursue your dreams. For me to be a tiny sliver in this dream makes me incredibly happy.”</p><p>The dancer also shouted out the fans who voted for them from week to week, saying that she and Williams were “so grateful each time we made it through.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘DWTS’ PRO PETA MURGATROYD DETAILS BABY RIO’S BIRTH STORY: ‘WHAT A WILD RIDE!’</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-williams-made-it-further-than-his-co-stars>Williams Made It Further Than His Co-Stars</h3><p>Williams isn’t the first Brady Bunch actor to compete on Dancing with the Stars.

His onscreen mother, the late Florence Henderson, competed in Season 11 with partner Corky Ballas.</p><p>McCormick made it to Week 7, while Henderson made it Week 5. Williams was eliminated in Week 8, making him the longest-lasting Brady Bunch star in DWTS history. This is good news for Williams, who wanted to outlast his TV sibling.</p><p>“I have to do that,” Williams told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, before jokingly referring to an episode of the show: “I lost that egg on the cone driving contest and she never let me live it down.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Modern-Family-cast-1-220x146.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara Shares Photos from First ‘Modern Family’ Cast Reunion" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57z56rmmWdqr%2BordOrprKcXaWyr7%2BMoZyaqqSbsq3AjK2popqlqbJuwM5mm7Cso2K9or7Tp5yrZZKWv7PFjLCgpaSZlrq0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-jonas-addresses-recent-injuries-after-mysterious-accident.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Jonas Addresses Recent Injuries After Mysterious Accident</span></a>
