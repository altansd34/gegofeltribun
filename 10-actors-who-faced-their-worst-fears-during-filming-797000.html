In&nbsp;some cases, however, the fear we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;screen is&nbsp;very real and we&nbsp;might not even know&nbsp;it. What’s even more challenging is&nbsp;when actors need to&nbsp;overcome their own phobias to&nbsp;film a&nbsp;scene, and we&nbsp;applaud every single one of&nbsp;them.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<b>Bright Side</b> dove deep into actors’ struggles on&nbsp;set and gained a&nbsp;new level of&nbsp;admiration for their work.</p><p><h2>1. Ryan Reynolds&nbsp;— claustrophobia in&nbsp;Buried</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e7/cf2/9af55653bf9e9a3cf1b580aeb2.jpg><p>Reynolds shot the entire film in&nbsp;a&nbsp;confined space which <a href=#>triggered</a> his claustrophobia and emotionally drained him. The struggle was worth it&nbsp;though as&nbsp;the movie turned out so&nbsp;realistic, viewers feel like they’re trapped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;box along with the main character.</p><p>He&nbsp;recalled the experience and said, “I&nbsp;just felt like&nbsp;I would never, ever, as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;I&nbsp;live, complain on&nbsp;a&nbsp;film set again after living through [the film]...<strong>It was tough, Buried was really, really tough, emotionally and physically. </strong>I&nbsp;left there changed.”</p><p><h2>2. Salma Hayek&nbsp;— fear of&nbsp;snakes in&nbsp;From Dusk Till Dawn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbc/a78/37fcce50f38d5183277054bfa3.jpg><p>Quentin Tarantino, who <a href=#>wrote</a> the screenplay for From Dusk Till Dawn, had to&nbsp;<a href=#>trick</a> Hayek into agreeing to&nbsp;film with a&nbsp;snake. Salma accepted the role without knowing this little detail and tried to&nbsp;refuse the demand due to&nbsp;her fear of&nbsp;snakes. Then Tarantino told her that Madonna agreed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the dance and Hayek realized she couldn’t pass up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the opportunity.</p><p>In&nbsp;the end, Salma’s scene turned out iconic, and it&nbsp;wasn’t too scary for her because she had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hypnotized to&nbsp;shoot&nbsp;it. She later said, <strong>“So&nbsp;it&nbsp;was good because&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;overcome my&nbsp;greatest fear. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;trance to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the dance</strong>... And there was no&nbsp;choreography. It&nbsp;was improvised. Because you can’t choreograph a&nbsp;snake, we&nbsp;don’t know what she’s going to&nbsp;do!”</p><p><h2>3. Sylvester Stallone&nbsp;— fear of&nbsp;heights in&nbsp;Cliffhanger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/033/9ab/4eb9be5009996089787240f7fb.jpg><p>Turns out that the mighty Sly has a&nbsp;weakness after all and actually had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tricked to&nbsp;do&nbsp;his role in&nbsp;Cliffhanger. The film’s director <a href=#>recalled</a> how he&nbsp;dealt with Stallone: “When he&nbsp;first arrived in&nbsp;the Italian Alps...he looked up&nbsp;at&nbsp;this 11,000-foot peak that was in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;us. I&nbsp;said, ’That’s where our set is.’ And he’s like, ’So who’s going to&nbsp;go&nbsp;up&nbsp;there?’ I&nbsp;said, ’You are.’ <strong>He&nbsp;looks at&nbsp;me&nbsp;and he&nbsp;says, ’You gotta be&nbsp;kidding. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;fear of&nbsp;heights.</strong> The highest&nbsp;I will ever go&nbsp;is&nbsp;the heels of&nbsp;my&nbsp;cowboy boots.’”</p><p>The director knew Stallone wouldn’t refuse to&nbsp;go&nbsp;up&nbsp;in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the crew as&nbsp;it&nbsp;would’ve been embarrassing, and slowly made him go&nbsp;higher up&nbsp;the mountain. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, they shot at&nbsp;13,000 feet and we&nbsp;got a&nbsp;thrilling movie thanks to&nbsp;Stallone’s bravery.</p><p><h2>4. Uma Thurman&nbsp;— claustrophobia in&nbsp;Kill Bill, Volume&nbsp;2</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65e/701/2eec505e3ca48ade5e05facccf.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most nail-biting scenes that came out of&nbsp;the Kill Bill <a href=#>movies</a> was when Thurman’s character, The Bride, was buried alive and needed to&nbsp;get out using only her skills. As&nbsp;intense as&nbsp;the scene was for the viewers, it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;picnic for the actress either. Thurman suffers from claustrophobia but <a href=#>said</a> that anyone would’ve been terrified in&nbsp;her shoes. <strong>“Well, I’m claustrophobic, but you don’t really have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;claustrophobic to&nbsp;fear being buried alive,” </strong>the actress said.</p><p><h2>5. Rebel Wilson&nbsp;— fear of&nbsp;heights in&nbsp;Pitch Perfect&nbsp;3</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40c/656/606d3750ef9c23dae7359cfdaa.jpg><p>While Pitch Perfect&nbsp;3, a&nbsp;<a href=#>movie</a> about an&nbsp;acapella band, seems like the last film to&nbsp;contain complex stunts, <a href=# title="Rebel Wilson" data-link=tag>Rebel Wilson</a> can tell you that wasn’t the case. The actress had to&nbsp;repeatedly face her fear of&nbsp;heights while filming and it&nbsp;was nerve-racking.</p><p>Wilson <a href=#>recalled</a> the experience: “<strong>I&nbsp;know&nbsp;I seem really tough but I&nbsp;am afraid of&nbsp;heights, that’s the one thing I’m afraid&nbsp;of. </strong>And I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this 20-foot jump 10&nbsp;times. And each time&nbsp;I was petrified.”</p><p><h2>6. Kristen Stewart&nbsp;— fear of&nbsp;riding horses in&nbsp;Snow White and the Huntsman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e8/92d/31d499576baa1955462b6af659.jpg><p>Stewart admitted that riding horses during the filming of&nbsp;Snow White and the Hunstman was a&nbsp;rather unpleasant experience for her. She <a href=#>explained</a> that there’s something about horseriding that doesn’t sit well with her. <strong>“I&nbsp;never want to&nbsp;get back on&nbsp;a&nbsp;horse,” </strong>the actress said. “I&nbsp;love them. I&nbsp;think they’re beautiful. I&nbsp;love their energy. I&nbsp;love being around them. I&nbsp;love petting their soft little noses. I&nbsp;just hate telling them what to&nbsp;do.”</p><p><h2>7. Matt Damon&nbsp;— fear of&nbsp;snakes in&nbsp;We&nbsp;Bought a&nbsp;Zoo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67a/26a/79dda854c0804ff941be0c930d.jpg><p>Scarlett Johansson exposed her We&nbsp;Bought a&nbsp;Zoo co-star when she <a href=#>revealed</a> that she “was watching <a href=# title="Matt Damon" data-link=tag>Matt Damon</a> cry like a&nbsp;baby and rock back and forth when the snakes were spread all over the set.” She added: “He&nbsp;was pretty terrified. He&nbsp;was definitely sweating a&nbsp;bit, and maybe the sweat formed in&nbsp;the corner of&nbsp;his eye. I&nbsp;said, ‘Matt, these kids are practically juggling the snakes. Hold it&nbsp;together.’”</p><p>Damon admitted that Johansson’s story is&nbsp;true and explained, <strong>“I’m afraid of&nbsp;snakes. And I&nbsp;got bullied into interacting with them by&nbsp;Scarlett and the kids.”</strong></p><p><h2>8. Jennifer Aniston&nbsp;— fear of&nbsp;being underwater in&nbsp;Cake</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff6/cd5/9151945362b62b79bf3097db82.jpg><p>Aniston’s <a href=#>fear</a> of&nbsp;being submerged stems from her childhood when she drove her tricycle into a&nbsp;pool at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;5. She had to&nbsp;face this phobia during the filming of&nbsp;Cake, which featured a&nbsp;therapy scene of&nbsp;her character being underwater and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;nightmare for Aniston. She said, <strong>“It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;30&nbsp;takes...I never will do&nbsp;that again.”</strong></p><p><h2>9. Jake Gyllenhaal&nbsp;— fear of&nbsp;ostriches in&nbsp;Prince of&nbsp;Persia: The Sands of&nbsp;Time</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/873/440/a4353151599478706b6392572b.jpg><p>Jake Gyllenhaal actually <a href=#>gained</a> a&nbsp;fear he&nbsp;didn’t have before during his work on&nbsp;Prince of&nbsp;Persia: The Sands of&nbsp;Time. It&nbsp;was very challenging for the actor to&nbsp;do&nbsp;work with ostriches and he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;being scared of&nbsp;them. “They would say, ‘Don’t make any noise around the ostriches. They’ll tear out your eyes and rip out your heart.’ So, I&nbsp;was naturally terrified,” explained the actor. “They look like they’re innocent, but they’re really not.”</p><p>Luckily for Gyllenhaal, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;run away from the birds in&nbsp;that scene, so&nbsp;his fear came in&nbsp;handy. His co-star, Gemma Arterton, witnessed the entire thing and recalled, “He&nbsp;was really scared.<strong> He&nbsp;ran away, and the look on&nbsp;his face&nbsp;— it’s not acting. </strong>It’s real.”</p><p><h2>10. Scarlett Johansson&nbsp;— fear of&nbsp;birds in&nbsp;We&nbsp;Bought a&nbsp;Zoo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/958/384/d1e04255949ef801dde73109f0.jpg><p>Similarly to&nbsp;her co-star Matt Damon, Johansson didn’t have the easiest time while working on&nbsp;We&nbsp;Bought a&nbsp;Zoo. Turns out, the actress has ornithophobia and had to&nbsp;face it&nbsp;on&nbsp;set with many different animals and birds. She <a href=#>explained</a> her fear: <strong>“Something about wings and beaks and the flapping. I’m terrified of&nbsp;them. </strong>That still hasn’t gone away. If&nbsp;they’d asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;bird on&nbsp;my&nbsp;shoulder&nbsp;I would’ve done&nbsp;it, but it&nbsp;would’ve been hard.”</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have any of&nbsp;the aforementioned phobias?
