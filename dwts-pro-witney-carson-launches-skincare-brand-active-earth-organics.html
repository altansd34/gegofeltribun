For her first ever skin care product, the Emmy-winning choreographer introduced a calendula body lotion.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-witney-carson-reveals-her-own-skincare-brand>Witney Carson Reveals Her Own Skincare Brand</h2><p>Recently, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carson</a> introduced her skin care life, explaining her skin concerns that prompted the creation of Active Earth Organics. According to the professional choreographer, she has long been looking for the healthiest products suitable for her body needs.</p><p>“Being a skin cancer survivor and a person who has struggled with eczema my whole life, I was on the hunt for the best and healthiest products for my skin. It was impossible to find something that not only smelled good but that actually healed my skin. I didn’t find it… This led me to creating my very own – Introducing&nbsp;@activeearthorganics&nbsp;infused with purifying silver,” she wrote.</p><p>Carson proceeded to explain that she chose silver for its natural healing properties. Describing the component as the “magic” that people’s skin desires, Carson said she’s proud of her body lotion. Furthermore, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS pro</a> gave a brief explanation about the product’s ingredients.</p><p>Upon seeing Carson’s announcement, fans were quick to congratulate the dancer for her new business venture. Many of them also asked how to order the product, stating the same skin concerns as Carson’s. Meanwhile, fellow DWTS pros Peta Murgatroyd and Lindsay Arnold sent their warm congratulations to the choreographer.</p><p>Omg I LOVE THIS! Congrats Wittttts,” Murgatroyd commented.</p><p>“Yay!!! So amazing!” Arnold wrote.</p><p>In her online store’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bio</a>, Carson claimed that she’s “on a mission to inspire transformative changes in the beauty product industry.” Stating that she believes in the nourishing qualities of natural elements, she encourages the switch to mindful choices of using toxin free beauty products.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-their-family-celebrate-a-toy-story-themed-halloween>Their Family Celebrate a Toy Story-Themed Halloween</h2><p>Early last week, Carson shared a glimpse of how her family has celebrated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloween</a>. This year, the whole family dressed up as characters from the movie Toy Story.</p><p>“McAllister Halloween 2023. The festivities have begun! Leo has been obsessed with Toy Story so of course we were all his favorite characters! So much fun!! The last photo I cannot handle. Can’t wait to see all your costumes this year!” she wrote.</p><p>For her part, Carson wore a Jessie costume while her husband Carson McAllister dressed up as Woody. Meanwhile, Leo looked adorable wearing a Buzz Lightyear costume. Lastly, baby Jet, whom they welcomed back in May, appeared tiny and cute in his Rex costume.</p><p>Carson and Leo also became baking tandems for the occasion, making simple Halloween cupcakes. On Instagram, the DWTS pro shared how Leo served as her sous chef during the baking process.</p><p>“Chef Leo did not disappoint! These Halloween cupcakes were so fun to make and delicious to eat. Love my little buddy!” she wrote.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_PeregrinePearson_SophieTurner-220x147.jpg alt="Sophie Turner Spotted Kissing British Aristocrat Following Joe Jonas Split" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>witney carson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuw8itpZ6xXZius7%2FOp2SlmaWjsKmx0maqpKGemK6zsYybqZqmlGKupMDIr5xmnZGnwal5zquemqaZmMBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dancing-with-the-stars-releases-new-season-32-promo-pics-fans-beg-for-premiere-date.html><span>←</span><span>'Dancing With The Stars' Releases New Season 32 Promo Pics, Fans Beg For Premiere Date</span></a>
