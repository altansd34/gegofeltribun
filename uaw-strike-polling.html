Support for the strike remains consistent among those who identify as members of a union and those who do not.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">By contrast, just 22% of U.S. adults oppose the UAW strike, even though a larger share believe the union leadership’s demands are excessive.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Survey respondents were specifically told that the autoworkers are asking the Big Three to: increase their pay by 36% over the next four years, reinstate annual cost-of-living adjustments and traditional pension benefits, allow for a four-day workweek, include paid health care for all UAW retirees, and limit the use of temporary workers. (The question of a four-day workweek for 40 hours of pay, in particular, has not polled well among the public, according to our <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>recent survey data</a>.)</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While 36% of U.S. adults said the union is asking for too much, slightly more said it is asking for either an appropriate amount (41%) or too little (5%). What’s more, after polling respondents on the propriety of the UAW’s demands, a follow-up question that again gauged support for the overall strike saw increased support for the UAW’s decision, to 57%, while opposition only rose to 25%.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The gap between the share of U.S. adults who oppose the strike (22%) and the share who view the demands as unrealistic (36%) might be explained by broader questions about labor’s role in the U.S. economy. When asked to choose between two opposing views concerning labor relations, clear majorities of Americans came down on labor’s side.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Asked whether “worker pay should increase whenever CEO pay is increased to prevent inequality” or “worker pay should not increase whenever CEO pay is increased because the work that they are doing is different,” 62% chose the former, while only 17% chose the latter.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A similar 61% share said “companies should provide strong worker protections even if it means higher costs for consumers” over the 15% who said they should provide weaker protections to lower costs for consumers.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And by a rough 2-to-1 margin, U.S. adults say “workers should exercise their right to strike if they feel that they’re not getting a fair shake from their employers, even if it damages the broader economy” over finding other ways to make sure they’re taken care of.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That the public largely sides with labor on these questions may help explain why support has held even as the potential consequences of the strike for consumers have received more coverage.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Given these findings, there is little reason to believe that public opinion is going to swing away from the UAW as negotiations continue with U.S. automakers — even if the strike drags on long enough to put a dent in the GDP and amid a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>slide</a> in U.S. consumer confidence in late August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6quuHnSramio5VivbC4y6KloA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-my-wife-matters-to-me-more-than-my-children-641010.html><span>←</span><span>Why MyWife Matters toMeMore Than MyChildren</span></a>
