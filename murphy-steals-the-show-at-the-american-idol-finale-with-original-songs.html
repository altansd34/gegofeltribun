He received <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most support and outrage</a> for his elimination out of any other American Idol contestant from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 19.</a> Many even declared that they would not be watching the show any longer because a true artist was sent packing. He had the potential to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">win the entire competition.</a></p><p>American Idol decided to do right by the fans and bring him back for a well-deserved live performance. The street musician living in Seattle, Washington performed two original songs at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the finale</a>. One is called “Am I Still Mine?” and the other is “The Painted Man.” He first performed “The Painted Man” back in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his audition</a> when the judges asked to hear more from him.</p><p>“Each year we scour the nation for the most unique talent out there. And this season, we came across one of the most memorable artists to date…Murphy,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Seacrest</a> said at the finale. “His elimination was controversial and nearly broke the Twitterverse. His early elimination sent shockwaves out. Fans voiced their outrage online, calling the decision one of the biggest errors in&nbsp;Idol&nbsp;history.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-opened-up-about-his-emotional-backstory-at-his-audition>He Opened Up About His Emotional Backstory At His Audition</h2><p>During his American Idol audition, Murphy revealed that he has a degenerative eye disease that has left him blind in one eye. He is expected to go completely blind in his 30s. He did mention further in the competition that the bright stage lights were a challenge for him and more damaging to his eyes.</p><p>Murphy made a career for himself as a street performer with the nickname “Blind Boy.” For him, building a music career has never been about the money or the fame. Instead, he wants to use his voice to help other people.</p><p>“I want people to look at me as an example of you don’t need a lot to give something substantial,” he said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seattle Refined</a>. “Particularly, I want to help people that have had a hard life. Like, by the end of it I want to have a homeless shelter. I don’t care that I don’t have a ton of money. I want to have something to show for my hard work.”</p><p>Despite his American Idol elimination, Murphy has already landed one huge opportunity. Actor Josh Gad was upset about Murphy’s elimination and asked him to write a song for his show Central Park. Truthfully, it feels like Murphy is the real winner of the season after walking away with so much support from fans and celebrities alike.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Michael-RozmanWarner-Bros.jpeg alt="Ryleigh Modig Former Star of ‘The Voice’ Shares Coming Out Story on ‘Ellen’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zK6pqaCpYsC1scClqmasmJp6tLTOsGSarF2ptaZ5wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2aemaOurbGMsKCtoF2kv6qzyKeYpWWjpLuov44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1482579-meet-josiah-jesse-ransome-kuti-grandfather-legendary-fela-kuti-nigerias-1st-recorded-artiste.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Josiah Jesse Ransome Kuti, Grandfather of Legendary Fela Kuti and Nigerias 1st Recorded Arti</span></a>
