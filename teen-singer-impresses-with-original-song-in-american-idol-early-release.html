The video features a performance from 16-year-old Haven Madison, who impresses the judges with an original song called “Fifteen.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-haven-madison-sings-in-american-idol-early-release>Haven Madison Sings in American Idol Early Release</h2><p>Haven is from Clarksville, Tennessee, and her father Jason is the lead singer of a Christian band. He joined her for her audition, playing guitar during her performance of an original song about being young and not wanting to wait for great things to happen.</p><p>“What if I want it now? / What if I don’t wanna wait?” Haven sings on the song’s chorus. “What if I don’t wanna waste my time waiting on someday? / What if I want it now? / What if I’m not the same? / What if it’s all a game and nothing’s ever gonna change?”</p><p>The judges were clearly wowed by Haven’s performance. As soon as she finished singing, Katy Perry stood up and responded to the question in Haven’s song, saying, “You can have it!” Lionel Richie agreed with her.</p><p>Haven’s dad was emotional after seeing the judges’ positive reaction to his daughter’s performance. He gave Haven a hug and told her she “did so good.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW CONTESTANTS ON ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ 2023</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvYtg5zRRSU</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-haven-got-a-golden-ticket-to-hollywood>Haven Got a Golden Ticket to Hollywood</h2><p>“Young lady, your songwriting ability is incredible,” Richie told Haven. “You can be anything you wanna be right now. It’s believable. Artist, voice, songwriting. Check, check, check. I don’t see anything wrong now, except the world doesn’t know a thing about you. But they will.”</p><p>Perry praised the “vocal decisions” Haven made in her performance, adding that her song “has a lot of opportunity to be something.” Luke Bryan said it was “really special” that she was able to speak to other people her age through music.</p><p>Haven received three “yes” votes from the judges to earn a Golden Ticket to Hollywood. You might remember that Haven was one of three singers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eligible for a Platinum Ticket</a> from fans late last year. That ticket ended up going to Elijah McCormick instead.</p><p>Check out the Season 21 premiere of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> this Sunday, February 19, at 8/7c on ABC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_CamilaCabello_AustinKevitch-220x147.jpg alt="Camila Cabello Has Reportedly Split From Austin Kevitch Due to “Very Busy” Careers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57056cp2WjnruosdFmoKaooprAtLHSZq6irJhivLO1xqKlmqRdqLyvs4yipWaZnZq%2Fqq%2FAp2SinJ%2Bheqat0aWwZqqVobKiv8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spain-royal-family.html><span>←</span><span>Spains royal family: A guide to the Spanish monarchy</span></a>
