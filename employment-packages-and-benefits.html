This is a weekly payment which is paid to you when you reach the national retirement age of 65 years old. It’s important to remember that the amount you’re eligible for depends on the number of years you’ve paid National Insurance from your salary in the UK.</p><p>Employers in Scotland offer all employees a workplace pension scheme, to make sure everyone is prepared for their future. The auto-enrolment scheme, which was launched in 2012, ensures that everyone is automatically enrolled into a scheme, though there is the option to opt-out if you wish.</p><p>If taking it easy isn’t your thing, and you want to continue working after the retirement age of 65, you can; you can also still claim your State Pension at the same time!</p><h2>Paid Leave</h2><p>All work and no play makes….well, you know the rest! In Scotland, all your hard work is rewarded with a generous amount of paid holiday time, because we know you deserve it! Your vacation time, known as ‘annual leave’ is calculated based on the number of days you work.</p><p>If you work full-time (five days a week) you’re normally entitled to at least 28 days of annual leave every year. It’s also worth pointing out that many companies do offer more than this at their own discretion.</p><p>If you work part-time, don’t worry, you still get holidays too! You can calculate the number of days you’re entitled to by multiplying the number of days you work each week by 5.6. So, if you work three days a week, you’re entitled to 16.8 days!</p><h2>Sick Pay</h2><p>No one likes getting ill, but it is good to know that if and when it happens, you don’t have to suffer financially on top of everything else. It’s important to note that all employers will operate their own sick pay scheme and you should check directly with them.</p><p>Over and above any employment sick pay scheme, you’re also entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer. Statutory Sick Pay is paid out if you are unable to work for more than four days in a row, but less than 28 weeks.</p><h2>Maternity Pay</h2><p>If you’re pregnant, you may be eligible for maternity pay from your employer. Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) allows you to take time off before and after your baby is born, meaning you have the time to get to know your new addition.</p><p>SMP is paid for up to 39 weeks from when you take leave from your job. You and your employer may agree other terms, but this is not required by law.</p><p>Your partner is also entitled to up to two weeks of paternity leave – in addition to another 26 weeks if you decide to return to work early.</p><h2>Other Benefits</h2><p>Most employers in Scotland will have a benefits package that will include a range of different things, from dental care to private health insurance. These packages are different for each company and it is best to check directly with them.</p><p><a class="btn-icon btn-icon--icon-left btn-icon--icon-external" href=#>Find out about all the things that makes working here work on TalentScotland.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjrCmq6NfmrqxuM6ypJ6mpGK9oq%2FKmp6eq12Wu6V5wZ6lnp6ZqcA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christina-rees.html><span>←</span><span>Christina Rees popularity &amp;amp; fame</span></a>
