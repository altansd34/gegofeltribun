The young star performed Adele’s “When We</strong> <strong>Were Young” and got four chair turns from the coaches. Watch the incredible audition below!</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-and-blake-shelton-remember-11-year-old-country-star-billy-now-all-grown-up>Miley Cyrus and Blake Shelton Remember 11-year-old Country Star Billy, Now All Grown Up</h2><p>Even though Billy had success prior to being on The Voice he decides to return to the industry at 28-years-old. By the time he was a teenager he was already the youngest artist to have a top 40 single in the country charts. His debut single “One Voice” was number 38 on the top 40, he also had a couple of Grammy nominations. Unfortunately he was <a href=#>dropped from label</a> in 2003 due to changes in his voice.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>SHY 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL PROVES AMERICAN COUNTRY SINGERS ARE NOT TO BE UNDERESTIMATED ON ‘AGT’ [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>Despite it being so many years later, Miley Cyrus and Blake Shelton recognize him immediately. The minute he introduces himself after getting four chair turns, Blake says “I know you.” Whereas Miley remembers that Billy had opened for her father Billy Ray Cyrus once. She even recalled seeing one of his music videos.</p><p>All four judges are super impressed and excited to see that he never gave up on his dream to be a<a href=#> country singer</a>. They also start fighting over him at one point, Adam Levine reminds Billy that he was the first one to turn his chair for him. Whereas Miley retaliates that she also turned her chair a couple seconds after. Even though Billy is a country singer, he decides to go with Adam Levine instead of Blake as his coach.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-billy-now>Where is Billy Now?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p id=h->After his successful audition, Billy dominates the competition. He advances to the finale and receives enough votes to make it to the top two along with Sundance Head. He ended up losing and being runner up to Sundance who was in Blakes team. Billy wasn’t disappointed to lose and admitted that he preferred being a runner up because you have more freedom and less contractual obligations then the winner.</p><p>Even though Billy Gilman had a successful time on The Voice and at such a young age, he currently doesn’t have any new music but his video “One Voice” has 11 million views.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘THE VOICE’ COACHES CAN’T STAY IN THEIR SEATS DURING THIS AMAZING BLIND AUDITION [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joel-Dommett-on-The-Masked-Dancer-2.jpg alt="‘The Masked Dancer UK’ Reveals Winner After Week-Long Season" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>auditions</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGgpZxdmLy2utOrsGarpJa%2Fbq3LpWSgqp%2Bsu27Bz2annqqWpL%2Buv4yapWaZlJq5pnnCpZisq5mYerC6jK2fnmWmpLaksY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./burns-supper-guide.html><span>←</span><span>Burns' Supper Guide | Scotland.org</span></a>
