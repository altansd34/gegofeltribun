However, the subsequent improvement also mirrors the most recently reported figures. This improvement has not abated yet, providing further good news for the brand.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/tesco20bar2.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Of course, there is still a great deal of work to be done both from an operational and marketing point of view to restore Tesco to its former glories. Whether this year is characterised by the slowing of progress for the discounters is very much up for debate, but perhaps the right strategy is finally being pursued by the larger supermarkets. We will be keeping a close eye on the data for the emergence of any new trends in the industry.</p><p><a href=#>This article originally appeared in City A.M.</a></p><p><a href=#>Find out more about BrandIndex</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWmBdX%2BMnJ%2BroaOpuqK%2FjJyfnp2iYsGmv8KoZKudk6TDpr7YZp6aoZ6oeq67zJ6lra2d</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1609813-cbn-slashes-customs-duty-dollar-exchange-rate-clear-goods-ports.html><span>←</span><span>CBN Slashes Customs Duty Dollar Exchange Rate to Clear Goods at Ports</span></a>
