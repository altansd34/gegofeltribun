It&nbsp;may not sound like a&nbsp;lot, but if&nbsp;you know 5&nbsp;single people, you most likely know at&nbsp;least one such person. Some people “really don’t need romance,” just as&nbsp;they claim. But for others, this reasoning may stem deeper than just not having someone who’s good enough around.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> we&nbsp;learned about a&nbsp;very common but not so&nbsp;widely known condition that stops people from falling in&nbsp;love and building intimate relationships. And that’s what we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;tell you about today.</p><p><h2>Why some people can’t fall in&nbsp;love</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a1/27b/5d4e3d5ef9a16dd39fe08c6efb.jpg><p>Psychologists name various reasons for this. For example, <strong>you might have <a href=#>low self-esteem</a></strong>. In&nbsp;this case, you don’t believe that someone could ever love you, and it&nbsp;blocks you from loving someone as&nbsp;well.<br><strong>Another reason for this could be&nbsp;<a href=#>perfectionism</a></strong>. You might have an&nbsp;ideal picture in&nbsp;your head of&nbsp;what your partner should look like, and don’t give a&nbsp;person the chance because they don’t fit this image. Your high expectations prevent you from falling in&nbsp;love with those who “aren’t good enough.”</p><p>But there’s something else you might suffer from without even realizing&nbsp;it. You might have a&nbsp;fear of&nbsp;<a href=# title=intimacy data-link=tag>intimacy</a>, which is&nbsp;often referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;“<strong>counter-dependency</strong>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da1/c9e/58eaaa56cbadbc332d5a4ea16b.jpg><p>Some <a href=#>signs</a> of&nbsp;counter-dependency include:</p><ul><li>Having trouble getting close to&nbsp;people</li><li>Pushing away people who try to&nbsp;get too close</li><li>Getting anxious/escaping intimate relationships</li><li>Constantly feeling afraid to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;mistake</li><li>Trying hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perfect</li><li>Refraining from asking for help from others</li><li>Always keeping busy and not being able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything</li></ul><p><h2>Counter-dependent people are generally those who escape intimacy and attachment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/125/fac/ce6c2e5efe8d8200aa322be56b.jpg><p>Such people are very <a href=#>reserved</a>: they require a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;personal space and don’t like anyone invading it&nbsp;because they’re afraid to&nbsp;show vulnerability or&nbsp;weakness.</p><p>However, on&nbsp;the outside, they usually look “normal.” They appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;confident, successful, and independent, and they try hard to&nbsp;look this way. They show that they don’t need anyone, even though this isn’t exactly true. On&nbsp;the inside, they’re very <a href=#>insecure</a>, needy, and unsuccessful in&nbsp;their relationships.</p><p><h2>They never learned how to&nbsp;experience intimacy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69b/ac0/a5207f58fba9aaf1e8ab6abb84.jpg><p>Like most <a href=# title=psychological data-link=tag>psychological</a> problems, it&nbsp;all goes back to&nbsp;their <a href=#>childhood</a>. They may have revealed their weaknesses in&nbsp;the past but were ignored or&nbsp;even made fun&nbsp;of. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, children learn that they should only appear strong and independent. The most common cause of&nbsp;counter-dependent behavior is&nbsp;a&nbsp;loss of&nbsp;emotional attachment to&nbsp;one’s parents or&nbsp;abuse toward a&nbsp;child (physical or&nbsp;emotional).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/131/e80/c2ae4c5ce0be550b529179eb98.jpg><p>Therefore, children <a href=#>learn</a> to&nbsp;associate closeness with rejection and pain. Their trauma teaches them that it’s not safe to&nbsp;trust anyone. Growing&nbsp;up, they were afraid to&nbsp;get close to&nbsp;people and open&nbsp;up. Romantic relationships are about intimacy, so&nbsp;counter-dependent people avoid it&nbsp;by&nbsp;blocking themselves from falling in&nbsp;love and pushing away people who try to&nbsp;get too close.</p><p><h2>But it’s possible to&nbsp;change.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fdc/54f/0046675447aff0ca147c28151f.jpg><p>Some people feel fine the way they are and don’t need relationships, deciding to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;their career or&nbsp;other aspects of&nbsp;their life. However, there are other people who seek out close relationships yet can’t do&nbsp;anything about their denial. Here are some things that can help you overcome this problem.</p><p><strong>Learn more about yourself.</strong> Read <a href=#>books</a>, psychology articles, ask questions, and reflect on&nbsp;your memories and feelings. The first step is&nbsp;understanding and accepting the problem, then later, you can work on&nbsp;it.</p><p><strong>Join a&nbsp;support group. </strong>You can try to&nbsp;overcome this problem on&nbsp;your own. Try to&nbsp;actually talk about your feelings and open up&nbsp;to&nbsp;other people. It’ll be&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this amongst people who have similar problems. You might also want to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;class that can help you learn to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more secure and test your boundaries.</p><p><strong>Ask for professional help.</strong> If&nbsp;you find it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;do&nbsp;yourself, you can work with a&nbsp;specialist. Tell them about your problem and they’ll help you find the core of&nbsp;the issue, move through the feelings you’re repressing, and open&nbsp;up.</p><p>Can you talk openly about your feelings? Share your thoughts with&nbsp;us in&nbsp;the comments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorGabkaPBbrLApaNmoZ5iubDCxGaaoZ2ToHq1u4ysnJ5lmZt6urvUZpirnV2Were1wq2gpmWfm3qku9Snq56qXZmysbHNnZynm6lihHqElW5paA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1451978-how-renew-drivers-license-without-going-physical-capture-explainer.html><span>←</span><span>How to Renew Drivers Licence Without Going for Physical Capture (Explainer)</span></a>
