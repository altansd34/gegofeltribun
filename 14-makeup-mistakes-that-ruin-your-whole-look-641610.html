In&nbsp;that manner, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite understandable why women would try to&nbsp;achieve the perfect makeup look by&nbsp;trying different techniques. However, makeup is&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;art and like every other form of&nbsp;artistic expression, practice makes perfect! In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;achieve this level of&nbsp;perfection, you have to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;few mistakes to&nbsp;learn from.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>searched for 14&nbsp;of&nbsp;the most common makeup mistakes that ruin our looks and destroy our skin on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis.</p><p><h2>1. Applying makeup on&nbsp;dry skin</h2></p><p>Many women make the mistake of&nbsp;applying makeup on&nbsp;completely dry skin. The first step is&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>exfoliate</strong> once a&nbsp;week and apply a&nbsp;rich <strong>moisturizer</strong> afterward. Women with extremely dry skin should apply moisturizer and even a&nbsp;primer before putting on&nbsp;their foundation. It&nbsp;would also be&nbsp;very beneficial if&nbsp;you carried some toner in&nbsp;your bag for refreshing your makeup. Finally, dry skin doesn’t go&nbsp;well with <a href=#>powder makeup</a>, so&nbsp;you’re better off sticking to&nbsp;cream products or&nbsp;asking a&nbsp;professional to&nbsp;give you advice.</p><p><h2>2. Applying matte lipstick on&nbsp;dry lips</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/688/dad/f43fee5fb7907f43c68c3dac28.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your lips get flakey after taking off your <a href=# title=lipstick data-link=tag>lipstick</a>, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;probably because you are using a&nbsp;matte lipstick without moisturizing your lips first. Like you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the rest of&nbsp;your face, you should exfoliate and moisturize the lips once a&nbsp;week and keep them in&nbsp;good shape for applying your lipstick. The best thing you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;add a&nbsp;<strong>lip primer</strong> right before you put on&nbsp;your lipstick. The primer will not compromise the matte effect of&nbsp;the lipstick like a&nbsp;moisturizer would, and it&nbsp;will make it&nbsp;look even bolder.</p><p><h2>3. Not changing foundations as&nbsp;you get older</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c3b/ba8/dfff1752d6aa6c218fc9a9af87.jpg><p>As&nbsp;you get older, many things change&nbsp;— including the <strong>elasticity</strong> of&nbsp;your skin. Your face droops in&nbsp;certain spots that used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tight and wrinkles appear in&nbsp;various areas. This means that the foundation you’ve been using when you were younger could highlight these areas instead of&nbsp;hide them. Changing your foundation based on&nbsp;the needs of&nbsp;your skin is&nbsp;vital and you’d better stick to&nbsp;liquid foundation since it&nbsp;will keep your skin hydrated.</p><p><h2>4. Pumping your mascara wand too much</h2></p><p>The bad habit of&nbsp;pumping your <a href=# title=mascara data-link=tag>mascara</a> wand in&nbsp;and out of&nbsp;the tube is&nbsp;terrible and it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;avoided. Too much pumping forces air into the tube, inviting <strong><a href=# title=bacteria data-link=tag>bacteria</a></strong> inside that causes your mascara to&nbsp;<strong>dry out sooner</strong>. Also, the bristles of&nbsp;the products become overloaded, making your lashes look all clumpy. What you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;take out the wand and twist it&nbsp;slightly at&nbsp;the end to&nbsp;remove all the excess product.</p><p><h2>5. Not blending your makeup down to&nbsp;the neck</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/238/513/ea964c5fd3a5fda4183a30872e.jpg><p>When putting on&nbsp;their makeup, many women forget to&nbsp;blend below the jawline. This bad habit creates an&nbsp;unsightly look since the difference is&nbsp;very obvious and not flattering at&nbsp;all. The best way to&nbsp;fix this issue is&nbsp;to&nbsp;blend your makeup <strong>under the jawline</strong> so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;doesn’t create a&nbsp;noticeable line. Whether you’re using liquid or&nbsp;powder foundation, remember to&nbsp;apply some of&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the lower parts of&nbsp;your face down to&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;your neck.</p><p><h2>6. Testing foundation on&nbsp;the wrong spots of&nbsp;your body</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b92/a6e/fc3313533284ade9a6f9c1cd07.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most common mistakes is&nbsp;testing makeup shades on&nbsp;your <strong>hands</strong>. Unfortunately, your hands could have more redness than your face, something that will indicate the wrong shade. You should test the different shades on&nbsp;your <strong>jawline</strong> to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;more definitive example of&nbsp;what each shade looks on&nbsp;you. For lip colors, you should ask for a&nbsp;counter sample and try it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;clean brush on&nbsp;your lips.</p><p><h2>7. Not changing your foundation during the summer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fde/d9e/a44d6350dea571f6dff4bb322f.jpg><p>The same way you change your clothing as&nbsp;the weather changes, you should change the <strong>shade of&nbsp;foundation</strong> that you use. 9&nbsp;out of&nbsp;10&nbsp;people have a&nbsp;complexion 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;4&nbsp;tones <a href=#>darker</a> during the summer due to&nbsp;exposure to&nbsp;the sun. The foundation that they’d been using during the winter will probably look very <strong>pale</strong> if&nbsp;used during the summer. This calls for a&nbsp;change in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;look as&nbsp;natural as&nbsp;possible and not call attention to&nbsp;your face for all the wrong reasons.</p><p><h2>8. Using too much glue on&nbsp;your fake eyelashes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/208/f7d/3c6c8e56acb52b5326e3c8b86e.png><p>When putting on&nbsp;your false eyelashes, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;of&nbsp;utmost importance to&nbsp;use the right amount of&nbsp;glue and not overuse&nbsp;it. Many women overuse it&nbsp;and end up&nbsp;with unflattering-looking lashes. What you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;put a&nbsp;<strong>small amount</strong> of&nbsp;glue on&nbsp;it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;brush and <strong>let it&nbsp;dry</strong> for 40-50&nbsp;seconds. Even if&nbsp;the packaging says less time, you should leave it&nbsp;on&nbsp;for more since the drier the glue&nbsp;is, the better it&nbsp;will stick on&nbsp;your lashes. Don’t forget to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;bit more glue at&nbsp;the ends of&nbsp;the lashes that tend to&nbsp;come off faster.</p><p><h2>9. Never cleaning your brushes</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you think that washing your brushes isn’t anything to&nbsp;worry about, you should think again. Dirty brushes invite harmful <a href=#>bacteria</a> that can cause skin irritation and <strong><a href=# title=acne data-link=tag>acne</a></strong>. Also, if&nbsp;your makeup makes you break out, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;probably because you are rubbing all that <strong>bacteria</strong> onto your skin along with&nbsp;it. You should wash your brushes once a&nbsp;week so&nbsp;that they will last as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;possible. Keep in&nbsp;mind that brushes are an&nbsp;important investment that could last you a&nbsp;lifetime.</p><p><h2>10. Keeping your makeup products in&nbsp;the bathroom</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/082/fad/5ca3545310b19a7c84d43e1c8f.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you’ve always wondered why your mom kept her lipstick in&nbsp;the <a href=#>fridge</a>, it’s time you knew the reason. Many beauty products contain <strong>natural oils and waxes</strong> that can be&nbsp;destroyed when exposed to&nbsp;high temperatures, especially during the summer. This means that you should make some room in&nbsp;the fridge to&nbsp;store your eye cream, perfume, nail polishes, facial masks, eyeliner, and lipsticks. This way their pigmentation won’t get cakey after a&nbsp;while and they will be&nbsp;fresher everytime you use them.</p><p><h2>11. You’re failing at&nbsp;contouring</h2></p><p>Ever since Kim Kardashian started contouring, many women have started to&nbsp;follow this method by&nbsp;endlessly watching tutorials on&nbsp;YouTube. However, if&nbsp;you’re about to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;wrong, don’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. Contouring comes down to&nbsp;4&nbsp;<a href=#>basic steps</a>: you apply your basic <strong>foundation</strong> and a&nbsp;<strong>lighter tone</strong> on&nbsp;your forehead, cheekbones, nose, and jawline. If&nbsp;you do&nbsp;that right, all you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;blend and the result won’t fail you. On&nbsp;the other hand, if&nbsp;you don’t feel sure about your technique, avoid contouring altogether. Your makeup will look great without all that.</p><p><h2>12. Forgetting to&nbsp;curl your lashes or&nbsp;doing it&nbsp;wrong</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/417/37f/a421a4527993a96e8a69b9ab60.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you love your lashes and want them to&nbsp;look ravishing, you cannot ignore using a&nbsp;<a href=#>curler</a>. First of&nbsp;all, you should never curl your lashes after applying mascara, since that could lead to&nbsp;breakage. Then, you should remember to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tender to&nbsp;your lashes and not apply <strong>too much pressure</strong> that will ultimately break them and give them an&nbsp;<strong>unrealistic curve</strong>. Instead, you should keep the curler on&nbsp;each eye for about 10-15 seconds and then apply your mascara.</p><p><h2>13. Not wearing sunscreen before applying your foundation</h2></p><p>Most women don’t realize the amount of&nbsp;harm they’re causing their skin when they expose it&nbsp;to&nbsp;UV rays without applying sunscreen first. <a href=#>Dr. Bruce Katz</a> advises women to&nbsp;apply a&nbsp;physical (<strong>non-chemical</strong>) sunscreen under their makeup until it&nbsp;is&nbsp;fully absorbed. If&nbsp;you think that the SPF your makeup already contains is&nbsp;enough, you are wrong. The level of&nbsp;protection it&nbsp;offers is&nbsp;very low and a&nbsp;separate sunscreen is&nbsp;needed. Besides that, sunscreen lotion is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great base for your foundation.</p><p><h2>14. Overdoing it&nbsp;with the brows</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4f/f92/decd02543cb3a30e6ab6d2989b.jpg><p><a href=#>Filling in</a>&nbsp;your brows with the exact same color as&nbsp;your natural hair is&nbsp;a&nbsp;habitual mistake many women make. A&nbsp;mistake like this can make your brows and face look <strong>too harsh </strong>overall. Instead of&nbsp;that, you should first use a&nbsp;thin, angled brush so&nbsp;that the hair on&nbsp;your brows will look as&nbsp;natural as&nbsp;possible. Then, you can start filling by&nbsp;mixing different powder shades in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;give your brows the color that suits them best and blends perfectly with your complexion.</p><p>How many of&nbsp;the above mistakes are you currently making during your makeup routine?
