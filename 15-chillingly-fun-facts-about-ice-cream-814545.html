For many centuries. No&nbsp;one knows for sure the story of&nbsp;how ice cream was discovered, but <a href=# title=it data-link=tag>it</a>&nbsp;likely dates back at&nbsp;least as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;the fourth century BCE. Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;wasn’t the ice cream we&nbsp;know today.</p><p>Alexander the Great, the king of&nbsp;Macedonia, would enjoy snow and ice covered in&nbsp;honey and nectar. That’s the early ice cream. The Roman Emperor, Nero Caesar, was eating snow flavored with fruits and juices. How would those guys get snow if&nbsp;they lived in&nbsp;very warm climates?</p><p>Well, their helpers would run up&nbsp;a&nbsp;nearby mountain to&nbsp;bring some from up&nbsp;there. I’m not sure how they were dealing with it&nbsp;without a&nbsp;refrigerator, but&nbsp;I guess they had ways. Some historians say that there were deep pits covered with straw, and the snow was stored there after harvesting it&nbsp;from the mountains. How it&nbsp;didn’t melt on&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;the pit remains a&nbsp;mystery to&nbsp;me. But <a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a> has many of&nbsp;those.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/057/421/08403753e69ad8fd99a47faf9c.png><p>Okay, so&nbsp;far, it’s been just ice and snow, but we&nbsp;all know it’s not the ice cream we’re used&nbsp;to. One of&nbsp;the main ingredients of&nbsp;the dessert we&nbsp;know today is&nbsp;milk. And this one most likely appeared in&nbsp;<a href=# title=China data-link=tag>China</a> around the 7th century CE.</p><p>Back then, the Tang dynasty was ruling the country, and the emperors probably were the first ones to&nbsp;eat ice cream that contains milk. Back then, it&nbsp;was made from buffalo, goat, or&nbsp;cow milk. To&nbsp;enhance the flavor and aroma, they were adding camphor to&nbsp;it. Then, metal tubes would be&nbsp;filled with the mixture and stored in&nbsp;an&nbsp;ice pool to&nbsp;freeze.</p><p>Let’s leave China for a&nbsp;little bit and move to&nbsp;the Arab world during medieval times. Time to&nbsp;observe what frosty treats they eat there. They used to&nbsp;drink icy refreshments&nbsp;— the earlier versions of&nbsp;sherbet. There, they were typically made of&nbsp;pomegranate, cherry, or&nbsp;quince.</p><p>Soon after, the Europeans picked it&nbsp;up, and it&nbsp;became popular in&nbsp;Europe too. The Italians and the French are the ones who especially adored&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;they took it&nbsp;from there and perfected it&nbsp;into their own versions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cab/846/886a575cc38c3aea639797d485.png><p>In&nbsp;the 17th century, Antonio Latini became the first person to&nbsp;officially record a&nbsp;recipe for his sorbetto&nbsp;— it&nbsp;contained fruits, ice, but also sugar, and milk. This is&nbsp;the recipe that most culinary historians consider to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first official ice cream. The Italians perfected their own type of&nbsp;sorbet, called gelato. In&nbsp;Italian, it&nbsp;means “frozen”.</p><p>No&nbsp;one is&nbsp;sure about who exactly invented gelato, but everyone knows the guy who opened the first café in&nbsp;Paris and started selling&nbsp;it. An&nbsp;Italian guy from Sicilia opened his “Il&nbsp;Procope” in&nbsp;1686, and the café became a&nbsp;favorite meeting place for famous intellectuals at&nbsp;that time.</p><p>That’s how the French were first introduced to&nbsp;the Italian gelato which was sold in&nbsp;porcelain bowls resembling egg cups. But you have to&nbsp;remember one important thing: never call gelato ice cream, especially in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;Italians. Even though these two might seem similar, there are many significant differences. Gelato contains way less fat, less air, and the flavor is&nbsp;more intense, and it’s also served warmer than ice cream.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/db5/a0a/431a8e5d0ea5e89dabceaf991d.png><p>So, that’s the Italian way. The French have perfected their own frozen dessert&nbsp;— the “fromage” [fro-maj]. This translates from French as&nbsp;“cheese”, but, in&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;has nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;it. Originally, it&nbsp;was made of&nbsp;cream, sugar, and orange flower water. Even today, the cream is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important ingredient, so&nbsp;the fromage is&nbsp;creamier and heavier than a&nbsp;gelato.</p><p>Also, did you know that eggs are used to&nbsp;produce both? Yes, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important gelato and fromage ingredient that gives the dessert the necessary fat, but also a&nbsp;specific flavor. We&nbsp;haven’t covered America yet. Most likely, ice cream was brought to&nbsp;the USA by&nbsp;European immigrants.</p><p>The first ice cream parlor in&nbsp;the States opened in&nbsp;1790 in&nbsp;<a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a>, but until the beginning of&nbsp;the next century, it&nbsp;was only available to&nbsp;the elite. But once it&nbsp;became more common, of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;took over the country&nbsp;— it&nbsp;couldn’t be&nbsp;any other way, could&nbsp;it?</p><p>When <a href=# title=NASA data-link=tag>NASA</a> astronauts were asked what they missed most, ice cream was at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the list. Today, 9%&nbsp;of&nbsp;all produced cow milk in&nbsp;the USA is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;produce ice cream. The people who love ice cream most in&nbsp;the world live in&nbsp;New Zealand: the country is&nbsp;the biggest per capita ice cream consumer in&nbsp;the world. The second one is&nbsp;the United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b46/5ab/5a43c25de082cec2d648a4c593.png><p>What do&nbsp;you think the most popular ice cream flavor&nbsp;is? Yeah, that’s vanilla of&nbsp;course. The second most popular flavor is&nbsp;chocolate. Turns out, chocolate ice cream was invented earlier: that’s because vanilla wasn’t available for a&nbsp;long time. Today, most vanilla is&nbsp;imported from Indonesia and Madagascar.</p><p>Today, over 1,000 ice cream flavors exist. There are quite a&nbsp;few really weird ones, like hot dog flavor, bacon, avocado, licorice, octopus, jellyfish flavor, and even roasted garlic. Then, there’s also cheese ice cream, and it’s a&nbsp;real and very common thing in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Philippines data-link=tag>Philippines</a>.</p><p>The Philippines only got ice cream in&nbsp;the 19th century, but it&nbsp;wasn’t widely available until a&nbsp;whole century after that. After refrigeration became widespread, an&nbsp;American opened the first ice cream parlor in&nbsp;the country, serving ice cream of&nbsp;three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Soon after, many more people started producing the frozen treat, incorporating locally available products, like mango, avocado, and coconut.</p><p>Instead of&nbsp;cow milk, Filipinos traditionally use milk from domestic water buffalo, which is&nbsp;also used to&nbsp;make white cheese. In&nbsp;the second half of&nbsp;the 20th century, cheddar cheese was first imported to&nbsp;the Philippines, and it&nbsp;became an&nbsp;instant favorite. It’s the ingredient of&nbsp;the famous Filipino spaghetti, and a&nbsp;common topping for pastries. Without thinking long, they combined their favorite cheese with their favorite dessert&nbsp;— ice cream, and they got an&nbsp;amazing, creamy-salty-sweet cheese ice cream.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/26f/b6d/90ab845364b230404a07b591c7.png><p>So&nbsp;yes, that’s a&nbsp;long story. We&nbsp;mentioned iced drinks, sherbet, and ice cream, but there was no&nbsp;word about popsicles. That’s right, popsicles didn’t exist for a&nbsp;long time. In&nbsp;fact, they were only invented by&nbsp;accident in&nbsp;1905 by&nbsp;an&nbsp;11-year-old boy called Frank Epperson.</p><p>On&nbsp;a&nbsp;cold night, he&nbsp;was mixing sugary soda powder with water and forgot it&nbsp;outside after. After sitting there all night, it&nbsp;got frozen. When the boy returned and found&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;lick it&nbsp;off the wooden stick he&nbsp;was stirring it&nbsp;with. He&nbsp;liked it&nbsp;so&nbsp;much that he&nbsp;started producing them. He&nbsp;called them “Epsicles”, honoring his own name, but later the name evolved into a&nbsp;popsicle.</p><p>Ice cream cones were invented just a&nbsp;year before popsicles, in&nbsp;1904. So, a&nbsp;guy was selling waffle-like pastries at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fair. Right next to&nbsp;him, there was another guy selling ice cream. At&nbsp;some point, the ice cream guy ran out of&nbsp;dishes and didn’t know what to&nbsp;do. So, his neighbor rolled his waffle and offered to&nbsp;sell ice cream in&nbsp;them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1cc/288/5fdee95967afa1552fd775dbf1.png><p>The history of&nbsp;ice cream isn’t even finished yet. Frozen treats keep being invented even today. For example, Slurpees were only invented in&nbsp;the late 1950s. Omar Knedlik was working at&nbsp;Dairy Queen in&nbsp;Kansas City, and the soda fountain broke down.</p><p>To&nbsp;keep the beverages cool, he&nbsp;put them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;freezer. They turned slushy, and that’s how the guy got the idea to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;machine that makes frozen beverages. He&nbsp;even created the Icee name and designed a&nbsp;logo for the brand. Several years later, 7-Eleven bought the right to&nbsp;sell the drinks, and they got popular.</p><p>The newest ice cream-like invention is&nbsp;Dippin dots. In&nbsp;1988, a&nbsp;microbiologist wanted an&nbsp;easier way to&nbsp;feed cows, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;freeze cow feed. Then he&nbsp;thought a&nbsp;little bit more and figured that you can freeze other food, not only cow feed. So, he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;freeze ice cream, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;blast.</p><p>That’s it&nbsp;for today. Maybe you can come up&nbsp;with something too, and will forever be&nbsp;imprinted in&nbsp;the ice cream history like all these heroes we&nbsp;mentioned today.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecKhoKWkmaO0rcWMn6ynZZaWsLW%2FjJqZqK2kYraksYycqZ6ZnWKFcoCUbWxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./popular-songs-different-languages.html><span>←</span><span>12 popular songs in different languages known around the world</span></a>
