The singer reached the Top 9 in the competition back in 2006 and went on to win a Grammy.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-alum-mandisa-s-cause-of-death-revealed>American Idol Alum Mandisa’s Cause of Death Revealed</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> obtained an autopsy report that reveals Mandisa died of complications of class III obesity, with the manner of death listed as natural. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cleveland Clinic</a> defines class III obesity (formerly known as morbid obesity) as when a person “has a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher or a BMI of 35 or higher and is experiencing obesity-related health conditions.”</p><p>The singer was found dead in her home by friends on April 18, having been “last known alive approximately three weeks” before. A rep for the singer confirmed her death on April 19, sharing that they did not know the cause of death at the time.</p><p>“We ask for your prayers for her family and close knit circle of friends during this incredibly difficult time,” read a statement on Mandisa’s Instagram account. “Mandisa was a voice of encouragement and truth to people facing life’s challenges all around the world.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABI CARTER NAMED ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ SEASON 22 WINNER IN GRAND FINALE</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-singer-won-a-grammy-in-2014>The Singer Won a Grammy in 2014</h2><p>Mandisa studied music in college before auditioning for American Idol Season 5, alongside winner Taylor Hicks and other notable contestants such as Katharine McPhee, Chris Daughtry, and Kellie Pickler. Mandisa finished in the Top 9.</p><p>The singer released her debut album, True Beauty, in 2007. She went on to release five more albums, including the 2013 release Overcomer, which earned her a Grammy for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album the next year.</p><p>Also in 2014, Mandisa lost her friend and backup singer Kisha Mitchell to breast cancer. She told People in 2017 that Mitchell’s death sent her “into a deep pit of depression.” Mandisa gained weight and barely left the house.</p><p>At her friends’ encouragement in 2016, Mandisa sought counseling, which was “what helped me finally start dealing with my grief.” She released her last album, Out of the Dark, in 2017. In 2022, she published the memoir Out of the Dark: My Journey Through the Shadows to Find God’s Joy.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Original_KellyClarkson_Show_Heidi-Gutman_NBCUniversal-220x147.jpg alt="Why Kelly Clarkson Doesn’t Want to Judge ‘American Idol’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Mandisa</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2arlZbAsLqMbmSapKWieq6tzZ2grJmjYrCiwdKeZKieXZmyosDHZqmerpWWuaawjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-logos-on-popular-items-are-always-on-the-left-797564.html><span>←</span><span>Why Logos on Popular Items Are Always on the Left</span></a>
