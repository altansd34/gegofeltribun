He&nbsp;was studying English literature and philosophy in&nbsp;Wisconsin, and because he&nbsp;wasn’t the best student there, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>move</a> to&nbsp;Los Angeles with his wife, Mary, in&nbsp;1964.</p><p>By&nbsp;that time, Ford was 22&nbsp;years old; young and handsome, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>managed</a> to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;contracts as&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra at&nbsp;Columbia Pictures. The roles improved slightly, but Ford was not satisfied, and his responsibilities were increasing as&nbsp;his family was growing.</p><p>This led him to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra way to&nbsp;earn money to&nbsp;support his family and not have to&nbsp;accept roles he&nbsp;didn’t like. That’s how he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>working</a> in&nbsp;carpentry. It&nbsp;all came about by&nbsp;doing repairs in&nbsp;his own home. He&nbsp;discovered that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;knack for it&nbsp;and started doing jobs for his friends and acquaintances in&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p><h2>His first job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;carpenter</h2></p><p>He&nbsp;began working for Sergio Mendes, a&nbsp;Brazilian musician, who commissioned him to&nbsp;build his recording studio. In&nbsp;1982, Ford <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> the kindness of&nbsp;the renowned jazzman in&nbsp;trusting him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartbeat.&nbsp;13&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;2015, the musician mentions in&nbsp;this regard that Ford “did a&nbsp;wonderful job.”</p><p>Mendes didn’t know that his commission was Ford’s first job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;carpenter, nor did he&nbsp;mention it&nbsp;to&nbsp;him. Nevertheless, the now acclaimed actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attributed</a> the project’s success to&nbsp;his library card: “It&nbsp;turned out very well, thank you, but that’s thanks to&nbsp;the books at&nbsp;the Encino Public Library.”</p><p><h2>New opportunities on&nbsp;the horizon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/544/8ce/92e6a25066830f605e90a48f26.jpg><p>Thus, Ford’s path to&nbsp;better opportunities in&nbsp;Hollywood was woven, alternating his work as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor and cabinetmaker; and as&nbsp;one thing led to&nbsp;another, he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;meeting influential people for whom he&nbsp;did carpentry work. Among them was casting director <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Fred Roos</a>. Ford was close to&nbsp;the role that would launch him to&nbsp;fame, all thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;door.</p><p>Francis Coppola wanted to&nbsp;remodel his office, so&nbsp;Roos recommended Ford. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replied</a>, “Yeah, I&nbsp;can use the work, thanks. But I’m only going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;night, when there’s no&nbsp;people around. [...] This is&nbsp;Francis’ office. I&nbsp;love being a&nbsp;carpenter, I&nbsp;love being an&nbsp;actor. I’m just not going to&nbsp;confuse the two.”</p><p>So, it&nbsp;just so&nbsp;happened that as&nbsp;Ford was finishing his day, very early in&nbsp;the morning, George Lucas arrived, who would use Coppola’s office for business on&nbsp;his film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Star Wars</i></a> (1977). It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;ordinary morning that would turn his life into an&nbsp;extraordinary one.</p><p><h2>His great moment</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c4/0c4/3654d25076b8c97624b081bca2.jpg><p>Lucas and Ford talked spontaneously, as&nbsp;they already knew each other from a&nbsp;small role Ford had played in&nbsp;the film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>American Graffiti</i></a> (1973).</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Fred Ross, Lucas’ casting director, called him to&nbsp;read a&nbsp;few <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lines</a>: “I&nbsp;read with more than a&nbsp;hundred actors. [...] They asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, and I&nbsp;said, ’Sure, why not?’” Ford wasn’t auditioning on&nbsp;purpose, there was nothing planned, but he&nbsp;did so&nbsp;well that, by&nbsp;force of&nbsp;fate, he&nbsp;won his first major role, playing Han Solo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ae/b34/201e885c788f535bbc5ae89a61.jpg><p>The rest is&nbsp;history. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Star Wars</i></a> (1977) was a&nbsp;huge success, the highest-grossing film of&nbsp;that year, which would end up&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most relevant film franchises to&nbsp;date. It&nbsp;was also the gateway that would lead Harrison Ford to&nbsp;stardom, with subsequent roles in&nbsp;major productions, such as&nbsp;the <i>Indiana Jones</i> saga and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Blade Runner</i></a> (1982).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b17/ac5/76ef53521d96b04ff0347dfbf1.jpg><p>Admittedly, woodworking proved key in&nbsp;the actor’s life: “Through carpentry, I&nbsp;fed my&nbsp;family and began to&nbsp;pick and choose from among the roles offered,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “I&nbsp;could afford to&nbsp;hold out until something better came along. But I&nbsp;never gave up&nbsp;my&nbsp;ambition to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor. I&nbsp;was frustrated, but never felt defeated by&nbsp;my&nbsp;frustration.”</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;having achieved his goal of&nbsp;becoming the highest-paid actor in&nbsp;Hollywood, Ford found the love of&nbsp;his life at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;60, Calista Flockhart, also an&nbsp;actress, best known for her role as&nbsp;Ally McBeal. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> at&nbsp;the 2002 Golden Globes and married in&nbsp;2010. Since then, they have been very happy.</p><p>Harrison Ford will be&nbsp;80&nbsp;years old this year, but his work does not stop. With multiple and notorious <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>awards</a> and nominations, he&nbsp;has shown his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>support</a> for important causes, such as&nbsp;environmental preservation, archeology, social work, and aviation. Soon, he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>part</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;comedy series for Apple&nbsp;TV, returning to&nbsp;the small screen as&nbsp;he&nbsp;did in&nbsp;his early days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2f/d07/dc014456cbb5ffbbce5f231f67.jpg><p>There’s no&nbsp;doubt that Ford’s story of&nbsp;perseverance and commitment is&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiring example, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-taught carpenter, responsible family man, the protagonist of&nbsp;unforgettable heroes, and philanthropist. His iconic legacy shows that passion and determination are the perfect formula for opportunity.</p><p>What would you be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;achieve your career goals, and what other jobs have you done apart from your main profession?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuw8CsZJ%2BqpajBs63TnptmmqWpeqp5zZ6tnqpdm7KtwIydnJ%2BdkamypXnHmqmroaOku26yzqubZpmemXqptdJmnKmhk2K%2Fqr%2FEZp2rp51isKK%2Bz56lrZ2iYsGwecKeo56aop7BunnAnKuoql1tfXh9j2xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-refused-to-share-my-inheritance-with-my-fiance-and-he-blew-up-817785.html><span>←</span><span>I Refused to Share My Inheritance With My Fianc, and He Blew Up</span></a>
