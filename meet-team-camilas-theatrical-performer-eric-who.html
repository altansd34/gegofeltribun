Without even seeing Eric Who begin his song, The Voice coach Camila Cabello knew he had the star quality. Here’s everything to know about the singer continuing into the Live Playoffs.</strong></p><p>Eric Who wasn’t an automatic stunner since the beginning of the competition. His Blind Audition of Billie Eilish’s “bad guy” was actually as part of a montage on the series, so fans were unable to hear what each judge thought of him.</p><p>“I turned around because I love this song and this voice and I wouldn’t expect and you have a beautiful tone,” Camila Cabello said. “He had a stage presence, and I love the spunky creative energy that I have on my team.”</p><p>Cabello was the only coach that turned her chair for the singer, so he joined her team by default. Eric returned to The Voice stage in the Battle Round to perform “Paparazzi” by Lady Gaga against Sydney Kronmiller.</p><p>Although Sydney impressed with her lower register on this song, Eric truly took over the show part way through. Both singers were unique, but the coaches thought Eric caught their eye more.</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Knockout Rounds</a>, Eric put on a theatrical rendition of Elle King’s “Ex’s & Oh’s.” Following Cabello’s coaching, he showed off insane stage presence. He had the audience roaring for him throughout this performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-was-eric-before-the-voice>Who Was Eric Before The Voice?</h2><p>Ahead of The Voice, Eric was known primarily as a social media influencer. He currently has 2.8 million followers on TikTok, 21,900 on Instagram, and 16,900 subscribers on YouTube. As of right now, it seems like Eric’s content mainly includes trying different drinks from various fast food places, including Starbucks.</p><p>Outside of his life as an influencer, Eric has released an album named Subscribe and an EP named The End is Near. His most recent collaboration “Hallelujah, I’m Single” featured Leo Deveaux. The singer currently has 442 monthly listeners on Spotify at the time of writing. Eric reportedly has released four other albums, but they are currently not available on streaming.</p><p>Eric has shown pure star quality out on the stage, so we can’t wait to see far he gets on his The Voice journey. Be sure to tune into The Voice on NBC on Mondays and Tuesdays to keep up to date with Eric’s journey.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_AlyssaWitrado_-Elizabeth-MorrisNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Alyssa Witrado, Gwen Stefani’s “Daughter” on ‘The Voice’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>camila cabello</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWkmq6uecKapKKkkah6tbTEmquroZOWuW68xKudqKqdmr9usdGimmavmKR8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-billy-and-emily-england-the-roller-skating-duo-joining-agt-fantasy-league.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Billy and Emily England, the Roller Skating Duo Joining 'AGT: Fantasy League'</span></a>
