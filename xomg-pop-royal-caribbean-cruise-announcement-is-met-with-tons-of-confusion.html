Although the ship offers seemingly exciting treats, some fans felt more weird than exciting for the cruise option.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-xomg-pop-to-hang-out-with-fans-in-cruise>XOMG POP to Hang Out with Fans in Cruise</h2><p>On Saturday September 25, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">XOMG POP</a> announced their next career move via social media. The girl group is inviting their fans to go on a Royal Caribbean Cruise alongside them next November. The fun-filled package includes several events for fans. XOMG POP describes the event as “packed with exclusive performances and fun-filled events for the whole family.”</p><p>In addition, the cruise experience will allow fans to hang out with the group through XOMG POP themed activities. These include a dance party, meet and greet, and concert at sea. For an additional $100 fee, fans will be able to join Club XOMG POP! and receive a limited edition swag bag.</p><p>Around the cruise itself will be tons of activities like zip lining, rock climbing, ice-skating, mini golf, and more. The cruise is set to stop at Coco Cay and Nassau in The Bahamas.</p><p>There are a few specific details about booking, including parties may not exceed three minors to one adult. According to the fine print, XOMG Pop’s group is subject to change and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JoJo Siwa</a> will “most likely not be in attendance.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Cruise Announcement Has Gotten Mixed Reactions</h2><p>While some fans have expressed their excitement after the announcement, others felt like the cruise experience is unnecessary. Conversations on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Reddit</a> say that the Royal Caribbean cruise is “strange” and “disappointing.”</p><p>“I love these girls and they are super talented and sweet but JoJo and Jess have really done them dirty,” a fan replied.</p><p>Many fans believe that XOMG POP is getting ruined by “poor” and “terrible” management. Meanwhile, others slammed the pricing of the cruise, claiming that the tickets are too expensive.</p><p>“This is only 3 days and the other extra activities are $100. In this economy, it’s a privilege to do that,” a fan wrote.</p><p>The cruise will take place on November 10-13, 2023, on the Royal Caribbean, Allure of the Seas. Subsequently, we are yet to see if this event will either be a hit or a flop.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Girl Group Teased Fans Following Kiya’s Controversial Exit</h2><p>After the unknown reason of 13-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiya Barczyszyn’s unexpected departure</a>, JoJo Siwa and Jess decided to not comment on the issue. Instead, XOMG POP proceeded to give clues to fans regarding the cruise treat, without mentioning about Kiya’s absence.</p><p>In one of their Instagram posts, the girls asked the fans to comment their guesses based on the hints they have given. Most fans thought of a clothing line, new music, and a concert tour.</p><p>As we know by now, fans ultimately guessed it wrong. We cannot blame them, though. A few to none probably had cruise on top of their minds. A cruise experience is a weird flex if not unlikely, but perhaps XOMG POP’s team had a different perspective.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NickCannon_BreTiesi-2.jpg alt="Nick Cannon Criticized After Bre Tiesi Implies She Can’t Afford a Night Nurse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5716ikoGWgpL1uvs6ymKVlk5a%2Fqq7BnpinZZOnwqq%2FxGaYp6afqrukscyepa1lmah6rrHTZq6irJhiwbC60mamn2WTpLunwdKipqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-maren-morris-is-glad-the-voice-and-american-idol-rejected-her.html><span>←</span><span>Why Maren Morris Is Glad 'The Voice' And 'American Idol' Rejected Her</span></a>
