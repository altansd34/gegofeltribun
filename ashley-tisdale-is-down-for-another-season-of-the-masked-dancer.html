The actress recently shared that she loved her experience on the first season of the show.</strong></p><p>Season 1 of the Masked Singer spin-off aired earlier this year on FOX, with <a href=#>Gabby Douglas winning</a> the competition as the Cotton Candy.

Tisdale told PopCulture that she’d love to see a contestant “that would just like really shock me.” For example, she thought Will Ferrell might be the Sloth, which she would be excited to see.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘MASKED DANCER’ JUDGE ASHLEY TISDALE WELCOMES BABY GIRL</a></strong></p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-the-show-be-back-for-another-season>Will the Show Be Back for Another Season?</h3><p>The Masked Dancer has yet to be officially renewed for a second season. However, the good news for fans (and Tisdale) is that it hasn’t been canceled, either. The network seems to be considering where to put it.</p><p>“We’re really happy with&nbsp;The Masked Dancer,&nbsp;we thought it was a great show,” FOX’s alternative chief&nbsp;<a href=#>Rob Wade said</a>.&nbsp;“We are just figuring out where it fits into our Masked strategy. We’re looking to see where and when that would play best. We filmed it right in the middle of the pandemic and we took a lot of lessons from it. We’ve got a lot of really nice ideas should there be a season two and we’re figuring out where and when that might be.”</p><p>Whether or not the show gets renewed, it’s nice to see that Tisdale is so excited about possibly going back.
