Despite Hailey being deeply pregnant, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>managed</a> to&nbsp;keep the news private. However, there were subtle clues for the observant eye to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;on.</p><p>Hailey’s personal style underwent a&nbsp;noticeable shift in&nbsp;recent months. Typically, one to&nbsp;flaunt some skin, especially during her annual Coachella appearances, this year she opted for a&nbsp;more covered-up look, donning an&nbsp;oversized leather jacket at&nbsp;the festival.</p><p>Oversized jackets became a&nbsp;recurring choice for her, often seen in&nbsp;recent photographs, where her <a href=#>waist</a> was cleverly disguised. During a&nbsp;recent vacation in&nbsp;Hawaii, fans spotted the couple, with Hailey dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;babydoll-style dress. Not only was this choice comfortable, but its empire waistline effectively concealed her growing stomach.</p><p><h2>Her skincare routine changed too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0dd/fdd/770f4c5a5ea38312dd804a3f84.jpg><p>In&nbsp;March, Hailey shared an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>updated skincare</a> routine with fans, focusing on&nbsp;addressing perioral dermatitis, a&nbsp;skin condition resembling acne or&nbsp;rosacea, via TikTok. In&nbsp;her routine, Hailey mentioned using a&nbsp;prescription azelaic acid cream and clindamycin, both commonly prescribed to&nbsp;pregnant women as&nbsp;they’re deemed safe for use during <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnancy</a>.</p><p>Last year, as&nbsp;Hailey and Justin celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary, they were well aware of&nbsp;ongoing speculation regarding their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> plans.</p><p>Addressing the persistent rumors, Hailey reflected on&nbsp;the scrutiny in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>. She expressed frustration, recounting instances where her bloating led to&nbsp;pregnancy speculation, lamenting, “There is&nbsp;something that’s disheartening about, damn, I&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;bloated one time and not be&nbsp;pregnant?”</p><p><h2>The couple, reportedly, has already chosen a&nbsp;name.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1d/005/7e6bc856d9bb2cfa86ed2c4f80.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a>, Hailey and Justin are overjoyed about the prospect of&nbsp;becoming parents. They feel prepared to&nbsp;embark on&nbsp;this new chapter in&nbsp;their lives and relationship.</p><p>Additionally, another source disclosed that the 27-year-old model and “Let Me&nbsp;Love You” singer have already chosen a&nbsp;name for their baby and have begun decorating a&nbsp;nursery.</p><p>Both Hailey and <a href=#>Justin</a> have openly expressed their desire to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;family. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;previous interview, the founder of&nbsp;Rhode Island shared her apprehensions about raising a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;the public eye. “I&nbsp;want kids so&nbsp;bad, but&nbsp;I get scared. It’s enough that people say things about my&nbsp;husband or&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends. I&nbsp;can’t imagine having to&nbsp;confront people saying things about a&nbsp;child,” she shared.</p><p><h2>Hailey may hint that she’s having a&nbsp;girl.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a7/807/a98db652aaa08ef1705d7405de.jpg><p>Fans have been speculating about the <a href=# title=gender data-link=tag>gender</a> of&nbsp;Hailey Bieber’s baby after she was seen sporting a&nbsp;pink butterfly top and beautiful translucent pink nails in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rhode post</a>. Many took to&nbsp;the comments section with their interpretations, with one top commenter suggesting, “Is&nbsp;she confirming it’s a&nbsp;girl OMG,” while another pondered, “it’s a&nbsp;girl or&nbsp;a&nbsp;blush.”</p><p>On&nbsp;platforms like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a>, users also joined the discussion, with one suggesting, “Maybe a&nbsp;girl? She’s wearing a&nbsp;pink top in&nbsp;her first ’belly’ photos.” However, it’s essential to&nbsp;note that these are speculations, and the couple has not confirmed the baby’s gender publicly.</p><p><h2>The baby may be&nbsp;due in&nbsp;August.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2e/da9/f023bc5c3a9d31a82e5665cfc3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the latest snapshots on&nbsp;Instagram, Hailey tenderly cradles her belly, heightening anticipation around her due date. A&nbsp;user recently stirred up&nbsp;speculation in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TikTok video</a>, claiming that a&nbsp;source close to&nbsp;the couple informed her that Hailey Bieber might be&nbsp;“six months pregnant.”</p><p>This revelation sparked excitement, with the user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarking</a>, “I&nbsp;have major breaking news. A&nbsp;source via Justin Bieber’s record label told me&nbsp;that Hailey Bieber is&nbsp;six months pregnant. Now, this makes a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;sense. I&nbsp;mean, Hailey, who is&nbsp;always used to&nbsp;strutting her stuff with her tummy out, has been wearing super baggy clothes, baggy jackets, and even at&nbsp;Coachella was really covered&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;cannot wait to&nbsp;see what baby Bieber looks like!?”</p><p>These hints suggest that Hailey Bieber’s due date could potentially be&nbsp;in&nbsp;August, aligning with the user’s statement and other sources.</p><p>Recently, another celebrity sparked pregnancy rumors. <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> became the subject of&nbsp;speculation as&nbsp;she made an&nbsp;appearance at&nbsp;the Billboard Women in&nbsp;Music event, dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;striking red ensemble. Her choice of&nbsp;attire sparked a&nbsp;wave of&nbsp;excitement and curiosity among fans and the media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWmvsSsZJ6ulafGtbTIp55mr5ViuK%2B71maYm6elqXqprcilnLJlkp6yo7HRrGSpqpWcu6K6wrJkrKddm66zecCnm2avmJbBbr%2FHnmShoZRis7O7zGasrGVoZoZxhJNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sports-personality.html><span>←</span><span>Emile Heskey popularity &amp;amp; fame</span></a>
