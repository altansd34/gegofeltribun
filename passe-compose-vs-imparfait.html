While these are both past tenses, they differ in their forms and use. The passé composé is a compound tense used to describe unique events completed in the past. Meanwhile, the imparfait is a simple, very regular tense that expresses past habits or repeated actions and describes people, objects or places in the past. In this article, we’ll review all you need to know about the passé composé vs. imparfait.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to form the passé composé</h2><p>In French, the passé composé is a compound tense made of two elements: the auxiliary verb avoir (to have) or être (to be) in the present tense, followed by the past participle of the verb. Let’s review the structure and rules for each auxiliary verb.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The passé composé with the auxiliary verb avoir</h3><p>Most verbs in the passé composé require the auxiliary verb avoir in the present tense. Only the form of the past participle may differ according to the category of the verb.&nbsp;</p><p>The past participle of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French -er verbs</a> ends in -é. For -ir verbs like finir (to finish), the past participle ends with -i. The endings of the past participles of -re verbs vary, but a common ending is -u. The following table gives you an overview of the passé composé for the three categories of verbs:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td colspan=2><strong>-er </strong><strong>verbs</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>parler</strong><strong>)</strong></td><td colspan=2><strong>-ir </strong><strong>verbs</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>finir</strong><strong>)</strong></td><td colspan=2><strong>-re </strong><strong>verbs</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>attendre</strong><strong>)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td></tr><tr><td>J’ai parlé</td><td>I spoke</td><td>J’ai fini</td><td>I finished</td><td>J’ai attendu</td><td>I waited</td></tr><tr><td>Tu as parlé</td><td>You spoke</td><td>Tu as fini</td><td>You finished</td><td>Tu as attendu</td><td>You waited</td></tr><tr><td>Il/elle a parlé</td><td>He/she spoke</td><td>Il/elle a fini</td><td>He/she finished</td><td>Il/elle a attendu</td><td>He/she waited</td></tr><tr><td>Nous avons parlé</td><td>We spoke</td><td>Nous avons fini</td><td>We finished</td><td>Nous avons attendu</td><td>We waited</td></tr><tr><td>Vous avez parlé</td><td>You spoke</td><td>Vous avez fini</td><td>You finished</td><td>Vous avez attendu</td><td>You waited</td></tr><tr><td>Ils/elles ont parlé</td><td>They spoke</td><td>Ils/elles ont fini</td><td>They finished</td><td>Ils/elles ont attendu</td><td>They waited</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The passé composé with the auxiliary verb être</h3><p>In comparison, only a handful of verbs required être in the passé composé. Fortunately, these are easy to remember with the mnemonic name “Dr. Mrs. Van Der Tramp.” Each letter of this name corresponds to the first letter of a verb that requires être in the passé composé. Here is the full list, including each verb’s past participle:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=6><tr><td><strong>Verb</strong></td><td><strong>Past Participle</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Devenir (to become)&nbsp;<br>Revenir (to come back)&nbsp;</td><td>Devenu&nbsp;<br>Revenu</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Monter (to go up)<br>Retourner (to return)<br>Sortir (to go out)&nbsp;</td><td>Monté<br>Retourné<br>Sorti&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Venir (to come)<br>Aller (to go)<br>Naître (to be born)</td><td>Venu<br>Allé<br>Né&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Descendre (to go down)<br>Entrer (to enter)<br>Rentrer (to go home/to return)&nbsp;</td><td>Descendu<br>Entré<br>Rentré&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Tomber (to fall)<br>Rester (to remain)<br>Arriver (to arrive)<br>Mourir (to die)<br>Partir (to leave)</td><td>Tombé<br>Resté<br>Arrivé<br>Mort<br>Parti</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>As they are used with être, these past participles work in a similar way to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adjectives in French</a> and take on different endings depending on the gender and the number of the subject they are linked to. The feminine form requires the addition of an -e, while the plural form is signaled by an extra final -s. The table below illustrates this with the example of the verb aller (to go):</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=6.5><tr><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Je suis allé (for a male)<br>Je suis allée (for a female)</td><td>I went&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Tu es allé (for a male)<br>Tu es allée (for a female)</td><td>You went&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Il est allé<br>Elle est allée</td><td>He went&nbsp;<br>She went&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nous sommes allés (for a male or mixed group)<br>Nous sommes allées (for an all-female group)</td><td>We went&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Vous êtes allé (formal for a male)<br>Vous êtes allée (formal for a female)<br>Vous êtes allés (for a male or mixed group)<br>Vous êtes allées (for an all-female group)</td><td>You went&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Ils sont allés (for a male or mixed group)<br>Elles sont allées (for an all-female group)</td><td>They went&nbsp;<br>They went&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-form-the-imparfait>How to form the imparfait</h2><p>The imparfait is one of the simplest and most regular French tenses. Here is the recipe you need to follow:</p><li>Take the nous form of the verb in the present tense</li><li>Remove the -ons ending</li><li>Add the ending for the relevant subject pronoun, like so:</li><p>Je (I) >> -ais</p><p>Tu (you) >> -ais&nbsp;</p><p>Il/elle (heshe) >> -ait</p><p>Nous (we) >> -ions</p><p>Vous (you) >> -iez</p><p>Ils/elles (they) >> -aient</p><p>Let’s see this in action with the same -er, -ir and -re verb examples as before:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=3><tr><td colspan=2><strong>parler</strong><strong> </strong>(to speak)</td><td colspan=2><strong>finir</strong> (to finish)</td><td colspan=2><strong>attendre</strong> (to wait)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td colspan=2>nous form in the present tense: nous parlons</td><td colspan=2>nous form in the present tense: nous finissons</td><td colspan=2>nous form in the present tense: nous attendons</td></tr><tr><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Je parlais</td><td>I was speaking</td><td>Je finissais</td><td>I was finishing</td><td>J’attendais</td><td>I was waiting</td></tr><tr><td>Tu parlais</td><td>You were speaking</td><td>Tu finissais</td><td>You were finishing</td><td>Tu attendais</td><td>You were waiting</td></tr><tr><td>Il/elle parlait</td><td>He/she was speaking</td><td>Il/elle finissait</td><td>He/she was finishing</td><td>Il/elle attendait</td><td>He/she was waiting</td></tr><tr><td>Nous parlions</td><td>We were speaking</td><td>Nous finissions</td><td>We were finishing</td><td>Nous attendons</td><td>We were waiting</td></tr><tr><td>Vous parliez</td><td>You were speaking</td><td>Vous finissiez</td><td>You were finishing</td><td>Vous attendiez</td><td>You were waiting</td></tr><tr><td>Ils/elles parlaient</td><td>They were speaking</td><td>Ils/elles finissaient</td><td>They were finishing</td><td>Ils/elles attendaient</td><td>They were waiting</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Even verbs that are commonly irregular follow the same pattern in the imparfait. The verb être (to be) is the only exception. It doesn’t take its stem from its nous form in the present tense — nous sommes (we are) — in order to form the imparfait. But once you know its stem is -ét, you can attach the standard endings for the imparfait:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td></tr><tr><td>J’étais</td><td>I was</td></tr><tr><td>Tu étais</td><td>You were</td></tr><tr><td>Il/elle était</td><td>He/she was</td></tr><tr><td>Nous étions</td><td>We were</td></tr><tr><td>Vous étiez</td><td>You were</td></tr><tr><td>Ils/elles étaient</td><td>They were</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-to-use-the-passé-composé-vs-the-imparfait>When to use the passé composé vs. the imparfait</h2><p>It’s one thing to know how to conjugate the two main past tenses in French. It’s quite another to decide which one you need, depending on what you want to say. Let’s look at the usage and examples that oppose the passé composé vs. the imparfait.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The role of the passé composé</h3><p>The passé composé is used to talk about completed one-time actions. As such, it corresponds either to the simple past tense or to the present perfect in English:</p><ul><li>J’ai mangé au restaurant hier soir. (I ate at the restaurant yesterday evening.)</li><li>J’ai vu Marc au bureau. ( I’ve seen Mark in the office.)</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The roles of the imparfait</h3><p>By opposition, the imparfait is used to talk about anything in the past that’s not a one-time action. This translates into three main use cases.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>1. To talk about past habits or repeated actions</h4><p>First, the imparfait can be used to talk about past habits or repeated actions, as opposed to the unique actions expressed by the passé composé. This is why you’ll often notice <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adverbs of frequency</a> being used with the imparfait:</p><p>Dans mon enfance, j’allais souvent au cinéma avec mes parents. (In my childhood, I often used to go to the cinema with my parents.)</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>2. To talk about continuous actions or actions taking place over a certain period of time</h4><p>In a similar way, continuous actions or actions taking place over a certain period of time in the past are expressed by the imparfait. This is often translated into the past progressive tense in English:</p><ul><li>À l’université, j’étudiais la finance. (At university, I was studying finance.)</li></ul><p>This is a scenario in which you’ll regularly find the imparfait and the passé composé together. The imparfait refers to what you were doing when the unique action expressed by the passé composé occurred:</p><ul><li>Je mangeais quand le téléphone a sonné. (I was eating when the phone rang.)</li></ul><h4 class=wp-block-heading>3. To describe a past event or action</h4><p>Finally, the imparfait can be used not just to talk about a past action, but also to provide a description. It’s very useful to paint the setting when telling a story in the past, for instance by depicting the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">weather</a>, a physical state or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">emotions</a>.</p><ul><li>Après le marathon, j’étais très fatigué mais j’étais heureux d’avoir participé. (After the marathon, I was very tired but I was happy to have taken part.)</li><li>Il pleuvait beaucoup hier et il y avait peu de monde dans les rues. (It was raining a lot yesterday and there were few people in the streets.)</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Be it the imparfait or the passé composé, it’s all a thing of the past</h2><p>Contrary to what you may have feared, the passé composé and (even more so) the imparfait are fairly easy tenses to conjugate in French. But once you master their forms, you’ll need to learn how to use them. In the passé composé vs. imparfait face-off, the former relates one-time actions in the past, while the latter expresses continuous, repeated or habitual actions as well as descriptions. Just one thing is sure: It’s all a thing of the past!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Anne-Lise-1.jpg><h2>Anne-Lise Vassoille</h2><p>Anne-Lise is a translator and copywriter working for various industries...
