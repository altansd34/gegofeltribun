This is&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;the woman who survived those horrific events and her beloved partner who never left her side through it&nbsp;all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e77/8f2/5175b0554988e7cc58d9521947.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2011, she was a&nbsp;mining engineer, living her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dream life</a> in&nbsp;Australia. Then, while competing in&nbsp;the marathon, she was caught in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;deadly bushfire. At&nbsp;first, she underestimated its dangers. But then, when the fire started to&nbsp;feed off everything in&nbsp;its path, she realized she had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all she could to&nbsp;survive.</p><p>A&nbsp;steep rocky cliff was the only place to&nbsp;go, so&nbsp;she quickly climbed&nbsp;it. She knew that fire travels faster uphill, and in&nbsp;no&nbsp;time, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the hottest possible place in&nbsp;the area. But she had no&nbsp;choice. She simply couldn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>outrun&nbsp;it</a>.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/22a/d59/db23c1584fba6fff09b31d677b.jpg><p>Though the fire hadn’t yet reached her, she could feel her skin beginning to&nbsp;burn. But all she could think of&nbsp;at&nbsp;the time was her boyfriend. She was afraid she would never see him again, and that thought helped her to&nbsp;stay conscious and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>keep going</a>.</p><p>Eventually, she was rescued. She was choppered out but remained in&nbsp;a&nbsp;coma with severe injuries. Doctors did their best but doubted her chances of&nbsp;surviving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/049/877/e95ff55ca0bd5b0083544fd049.jpg><p>She no&nbsp;longer looked like she did before but managed to&nbsp;survive. Altogether, she spent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2&nbsp;years</a> in&nbsp;recovery and underwent reconstructive surgeries on&nbsp;her hands, face, and body.</p><p>And all this time, Michael, her boyfriend, remained right by&nbsp;her side. He&nbsp;even bought an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>engagement</a> ring while she was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;coma. He&nbsp;strongly believed there would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;day he&nbsp;would give her that ring and they would get married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/319/3b2/51dc4a52d9ae105b58a12438fa.jpg><p>On&nbsp;that fateful day, Michael was away on&nbsp;business. He&nbsp;was told that Turia was on&nbsp;her way to&nbsp;the hospital. But the doctors let him know he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;expect the worst. For the first time in&nbsp;his life, he&nbsp;faced an&nbsp;absolute <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nightmare</a>.</p><p>He&nbsp;gave up&nbsp;work to&nbsp;care for Turia and stayed at&nbsp;her bedside for a&nbsp;month, hoping everything would be&nbsp;fine. He&nbsp;was taught how to&nbsp;change her dressings and feed her and knew exactly when she had to&nbsp;take each of&nbsp;her pills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c3/8bd/637c4d5d7baa80751e85c7181d.jpg><p>The following months were the hardest. They were filled with frustration, but Michael supported her through it&nbsp;all.</p><p>She admits at&nbsp;times that she found herself losing her temper with him. She wished he&nbsp;would give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;her, but he&nbsp;never did. His love made her realize she couldn’t just give up&nbsp;either. So&nbsp;she gathered herself up&nbsp;and worked hard to&nbsp;regain her health and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>strength</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b8a/ef8/d92aa858bcab16b7df0b658815.jpg><p>Looking in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mirror was the worst part. It&nbsp;took her many more months to&nbsp;finally accept her new appearance. Mostly because of&nbsp;Michael, who constantly kept telling her, “I&nbsp;love your beautiful eyes,” “You’re looking beautiful today Turia. What are you going to&nbsp;achieve today?”</p><p>Many people wondered why Michael chose to&nbsp;stay. And he&nbsp;replied, “I&nbsp;was attracted to&nbsp;her soul and her character. She’s the only woman that will continue to&nbsp;fulfill my&nbsp;dreams.”</p><p>Eventually, that helped Turia to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;love and accept herself. And now she sees the same beautiful girl in&nbsp;the mirror that Michael sees. She knows that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beauty</a> comes from within and what really matters is&nbsp;who we&nbsp;are, not what we&nbsp;look like.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c5/910/d4335f59d1bc7ec5cf094665c8.jpg><p>The couple overcame the trials of&nbsp;the injuries and recovery together and finally got married in&nbsp;2016. Now they have a&nbsp;new life and 2&nbsp;beautiful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>children</a>. Turia is&nbsp;still considered a&nbsp;medical marvel and went back to&nbsp;running, and she gives motivational speeches from time to&nbsp;time.</p><p>Never once did Michael treat her differently. He&nbsp;was in&nbsp;love with her personality before, which she’s still got. Their story is&nbsp;just more proof that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>real love</a> exists and can withstand anything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a2/3db/83a1c45e23a8419818fa7fdf86.jpg><p>What about you?
