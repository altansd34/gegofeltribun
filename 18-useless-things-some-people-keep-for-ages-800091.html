During the 3&nbsp;weeks of&nbsp;this passive process, I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;throw away 2&nbsp;huge bags of&nbsp;useless stuff. I&nbsp;threw away some of&nbsp;it, and donated the rest to&nbsp;charity organizations. I’ve even managed to&nbsp;sell some of&nbsp;the things online and now my&nbsp;apartment has more space.</p><p>The most important thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;your apartment as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s the first time you’ve ever seen&nbsp;it. Every box, every magnet, every piece of&nbsp;paper. Your goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;decide if&nbsp;you really need something. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;share my&nbsp;experience with <strong>Bright Side</strong> readers and talk about what you can easily get rid of&nbsp;right now. And at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, there’s a&nbsp;bonus on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;create order in&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital world.</p><p><h2>Old bed linens and towels</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a8b/491/4ec3795d7f89cae08d423d6389.jpg><p>Bed linens not only contribute to&nbsp;the interior design of&nbsp;the bedroom, but they also <a href=#>influence</a> the quality of&nbsp;your sleep. You may have gotten used to&nbsp;your current bed linens, but you should give them a&nbsp;clear look: if&nbsp;they’re faded or&nbsp;if&nbsp;they have some holes, it’s time to&nbsp;throw them away. For starters, choose a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;the worst sets that you have and throw them away and it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good reason to&nbsp;buy new ones.</p><p>You don’t have to&nbsp;actually throw away bed linens and old towels: you can donate them to&nbsp;nursing <a href=# title=homes data-link=tag>homes</a> or&nbsp;animal shelters. You can do&nbsp;something good and still get rid of&nbsp;your old stuff.</p><p><h2>Hangers from clothing stores</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/429/54f/3b204c53b9956a7ce6e33e6f54.jpg><p>Many of&nbsp;us adopted the habit of&nbsp;not throwing anything away, but this is&nbsp;often pointless. The bad <a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> hangers we&nbsp;get for free when buying something at&nbsp;a&nbsp;store don’t look good and don’t keep their shape for a&nbsp;long time. You probably have enough money to&nbsp;replace them with better ones.</p><p><h2>Things without a&nbsp;match</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/337/416/07402d56d7a7c3f47ec1ac9839.jpg><p>No&nbsp;matter how much you love some of&nbsp;your socks, gloves, or&nbsp;earrings, if&nbsp;you can’t find their match, it’s pointless to&nbsp;keep them. Of&nbsp;course, if&nbsp;you have some gold, you can sell it&nbsp;but there’s not much you can do&nbsp;with old socks, gloves, or&nbsp;cheap rings.</p><p><h2>Useless cards</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa1/d01/967a045c02b0e7651e520fd96e.jpg><p>Many stores and services offer discount cards. If&nbsp;you didn’t love the service or&nbsp;the store is&nbsp;somewhere you are not likely to&nbsp;go&nbsp;again, there’s no&nbsp;point keeping these cards. The same is&nbsp;true for business cards, especially if&nbsp;you got them several years ago and have never used them since.</p><p><h2>Old underwear</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/543/2e1/fbaacf571c8d01aeef6418241a.jpg><p>Even if&nbsp;you are the only person that sees your underwear, don’t wear old undergarments. This attitude toward yourself lowers your self-esteem because when you agree to&nbsp;something bad, <strong>you’re <a href=#>depriving</a> yourself of&nbsp;something good</strong>. Besides, a&nbsp;regular bra is&nbsp;only <a href=#>good</a> for 6&nbsp;months to&nbsp;one year. After that, it&nbsp;doesn’t perform its function of&nbsp;supporting the breasts well.</p><p><h2>Empty boxes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84b/64e/0cf12f5dceb33836700585948e.jpg><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;explain why many of&nbsp;us keep different boxes. Let’s be&nbsp;honest: the box from a&nbsp;new&nbsp;TV, ice skates, <a href=# title=toys data-link=tag>toys</a>, or&nbsp;kitchen stuff is&nbsp;<strong>something you are never going to&nbsp;use again</strong>. You can bring these boxes to&nbsp;a&nbsp;paper recycling unit.</p><p><h2>Clothes and shoes that are not necessary for your lifestyle now</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae8/b5e/c6a6225332906cb26adec368a1.jpg><p>I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;love wearing short skirts and dresses. <strong>I&nbsp;can still wear them but&nbsp;I don’t really want&nbsp;to.</strong> This is&nbsp;why&nbsp;I seriously reconsidered my&nbsp;wardrobe and&nbsp;I got rid of&nbsp;all the clothes and shoes that are not my&nbsp;style anymore. The clothes that were in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good condition, I&nbsp;sold online, the rest&nbsp;I donated to&nbsp;charity organizations. It&nbsp;feels so&nbsp;good when you give a&nbsp;second life to&nbsp;the things you’ve gotten tired&nbsp;of.</p><p><h2>Wires and cases from old phones</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/487/910/9550d550dbbdbc4d687cc8332d.jpg><p>Again, you have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;smart about this: Are you really going to&nbsp;need a&nbsp;case for the phone you don’t use anymore? Maybe the charger will be&nbsp;useful if&nbsp;you’re still using the same brand. Throw away broken disks and flash drives.</p><p><h2>Jewelry and accessories you’re not going to&nbsp;wear</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c7/7a8/b2aa9d506ba4e167ea222e6e17.jpg><p>I&nbsp;like jewelry that is&nbsp;cheap and different. You can buy something that is&nbsp;really trendy and get rid of&nbsp;it&nbsp;when the trend is&nbsp;gone. The same is&nbsp;true for the cheap bags and headscarves that&nbsp;I bought impulsively. I&nbsp;donated these things and&nbsp;I hope they can make someone else happy.</p><p><h2>Paper trash</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/420/474/1bd9cd5d6fba6f6d83692e409e.jpg><p>Old notes, warranty papers, contracts you don’t need anymore&nbsp;— people keep this stuff for decades. You can do&nbsp;the same with this trash that you did with the boxes.</p><p><h2>Everything that’s expired</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d6/d78/a78d5e5351852633012bc5bee2.jpg><p>I&nbsp;throw away expired foods as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I see them. But when&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;check the medications, beauty products, detergents, and stuff like that, I&nbsp;was surprised: half of&nbsp;the things&nbsp;I had were expired. I&nbsp;don’t know what might happen if&nbsp;you use expired face cream but who wants to&nbsp;risk their health to&nbsp;find out?</p><p><h2>Broken and useless toys</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f55/6ff/f9ffc85911aa40cf342afad4fc.jpg><p>It’s not always easy to&nbsp;talk your kid into throwing away some of&nbsp;the toys they don’t play with. But <strong>kids grow up&nbsp;and their interests change.</strong> In&nbsp;my&nbsp;house, we&nbsp;have the rule of&nbsp;2&nbsp;boxes: when the toys don’t fit there, we&nbsp;check what can be&nbsp;thrown away. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;toy is&nbsp;broken, we&nbsp;throw it&nbsp;away, and if&nbsp;it’s functional, we&nbsp;give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;charity or&nbsp;sell&nbsp;it. We&nbsp;can buy something new with the money we&nbsp;get and it&nbsp;saves money and space.</p><p><h2>Plates with dents and other defects, and those you simply don’t like</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/284/a20/55e6725a8eb1181a313476eb72.jpg><p>Plates with damage not only look bad, but they are also not safe. For example, if&nbsp;you cook on&nbsp;something with a&nbsp;damaged Teflon cover, you can <a href=#>get</a> the so-called <strong>polymer-fume fever</strong>. Throw this stuff away immediately.</p><p>The same is&nbsp;true for plates and glasses that someone gave you 10&nbsp;years ago and that you just don’t like. Try selling them, and give up&nbsp;any hope that you will love them one day. Someone will use them and that is&nbsp;better than having them take up&nbsp;space in&nbsp;your house.</p><p><h2>Books you are not going to&nbsp;read again</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2fc/300/0ee1af5194b1bff2ebc329ec25.jpg><p>I&nbsp;love paper books which is&nbsp;why&nbsp;I often buy them. But there are some in&nbsp;my&nbsp;collection that I’ve read once and&nbsp;I will probably never open again. There’s no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;keep them, so&nbsp;I gave them to&nbsp;a&nbsp;library. They were happy to&nbsp;take these books and I’m happy that someone will read them and enjoy them.</p><p><h2>Old washcloths and toothbrushes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9e/544/4e3d4a5018b1f3bfdf53c5cd49.jpg><p>Experts say that we&nbsp;should <a href=#>change</a> our toothbrushes once every 3-4 months or&nbsp;even more often if&nbsp;you’ve been ill. Washcloths can be&nbsp;used for about 6&nbsp;months and then they turn into <strong>a&nbsp;perfect environment for germs.</strong> Replace these things&nbsp;— it&nbsp;not only feels good, but it’s also healthy.</p><p><h2>Everything broken and unused</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/198/b0e/ab6cba537d866804c0c90cf7c4.jpg><p>A&nbsp;burned coffee maker, a&nbsp;kettle that doesn’t turn&nbsp;on, a&nbsp;watch that doesn’t work, and boots that have holes in&nbsp;them. Everyone probably has something like this. You always think, “I’ll get it&nbsp;fixed” but let’s be&nbsp;honest: you will never do&nbsp;this. Either get it&nbsp;fixed now or&nbsp;throw this stuff away.</p><p><h2>Souvenirs and magnets you don’t like</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/939/366/07986253b5a71bf59ddfef50fb.jpg><p>Cheap things that colleagues and relatives give to&nbsp;us are kept for years out of&nbsp;politeness. All these plastic things don’t make&nbsp;us happy and they just collect the dust. Take a&nbsp;good look at&nbsp;your souvenirs and only keep the things you really like or&nbsp;love. Throw away the rest.</p><p><h2>Everything that has ended</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b58/077/a44650590e929a554b7eaf20bc.jpg><p>When I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;child, I&nbsp;never threw away pens because&nbsp;I could buy a&nbsp;pencil refill and use it&nbsp;again. Now, the pens are cheap and it’s easier to&nbsp;buy new ones. Check anything that could have dried&nbsp;up: from nail polishes to&nbsp;markers.</p><p>The same goes for perfumes that you don’t like or&nbsp;that are finished. Experts claim that you can’t <a href=#>store</a> perfumes for more than 3-5&nbsp;years. Expired perfumes might cause an&nbsp;allergic reaction or&nbsp;just change the smell, so&nbsp;why take the risk?</p><p><h2>Bonus: Don’t forget to&nbsp;sort your e-mail and your social media</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45a/de9/8b70455e23b1622ad18bfee886.jpg><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;imagine life today without online communication, so&nbsp;it’s better to&nbsp;sort out your online space too. Look at&nbsp;your contacts on&nbsp;social media and think about whether you need all the people you have on&nbsp;your list of&nbsp;friends. If&nbsp;you can’t remember someone and you see that they were online in&nbsp;2015 last time, you don’t need this contact.</p><p>In&nbsp;my&nbsp;e-mail box, there were more than 25,000 letters and after sorting them out, I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;with 10&nbsp;times fewer. Because of&nbsp;piles of&nbsp;garbage and useless notifications, I&nbsp;missed some really important work-related messages which&nbsp;I found accidentally. Do&nbsp;this at&nbsp;least twice a&nbsp;year so&nbsp;you don’t miss some good opportunities.</p><p>What other things do&nbsp;you think should definitely be&nbsp;thrown away?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH55edSsnKWdo6h6tbTIp56sZaOkuqZ5z56mqaSVYrimsc9mnaiqXZa0pr%2BMcWdpaGlmfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./16-celebrities-that-shine-on-the-red-carpet-but-dress-like-regular-people-in-their-everyday-lives-802079.html><span>←</span><span>16 Celebrities That Shine on the Red Carpet but Dress Like Regular People in Their Everyday Lives</span></a>
