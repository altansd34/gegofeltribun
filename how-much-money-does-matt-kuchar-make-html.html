He HAS earned over $30 million in prize money and recorded over 80 top-10 finishes.</p><p>Kuchar briefly enjoyed success in the early 2000s before suffering a slump where he struggled to maintain his playing status on the PGA Tour. He rejuvenated himself and built a new, one-plane swing from 2008 onward leading to improved results. Kuchar was the PGA Tour's leading money winner in 2010.</p><p>Kuchar won The Players Championship in 2012, the flagship event of the PGA Tour, his biggest tournament victory to date. As a result, he moved to a career high number five in the world rankings and has spent over 40 weeks ranked inside its top-10.</p><p>At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Kuchar won the first Olympic bronze medal awarded for golf since the 1904 Summer Olympics.</p><p>With Sergio GarcÃ­a winning the 2017 Masters Tournament and Steve Stricker playing part-time on the PGA Tour Champions, Kuchar ended 2017 as the highest-earning active full-time PGA Tour player without a major championship win, with career earnings of over $41 million. The closest he has come was his second placed finish in the 2017 Open Championship at Royal Birkdale Golf Club.</p>Net Worth:<h3>Matt Kuchar Net Worth: $<span id=Total>100 Million</span></h3><b>Matt Kuchar's Income / Salary:</b><br><b>Per Year:</b> $<span id=Year>20 Million</span><p><b>Per Month:</b> $<span id=Month>2 Million</span></p><p><b>Per Week:</b> $<span id=Week>500,000</span></p><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><td><b>Per Day:</b></td><td><b>Per Hour:</b></td><td><b>Per Minute:</b></td><td><b>Per Second:</b></td></tr><tr><td>$<span id=Day>70,000</span><span></span></td><td>$<span id=Hour>3,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Minute>50</span></td><td>$<span id=Second>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Since you arrived on this page at <span id=CurrentTime></span>Matt Kuchar Earned: <span id=earnNow></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmwp6KptW%2B6xK1ma2hhbXxxg46hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjKaYraxdoMKktMCrZKaZm5p7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-martin-henderson-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Martin Henderson Make?
