Despite some media speculation about her dating life, she has skillfully maintained a&nbsp;level of&nbsp;privacy. However, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent revelation, the star shared an&nbsp;update on&nbsp;her dating life and disclosed the reasons behind her choice to&nbsp;remain “unattached.”</p><p><h2>The men of&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30c/14b/9f8a9f53a2b61062b273fed275.jpg><p>Back in&nbsp;the rad ’80s and ’90s, Linda Evangelista was basically the rockstar of&nbsp;the modeling world. This Canadian beauty wasn’t just strutting down runways—she was the muse for big shots like Versace and Lagerfeld.</p><p>But here’s the twist: Linda wasn’t just making headlines for her killer career. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dove</a> into a&nbsp;wild ride when, at&nbsp;22, she tied the knot with Gerald Marie, a&nbsp;French modeling-agency bigwig, who was 15&nbsp;years her senior, in&nbsp;1987. They seemed like the ultimate power couple—her, the world’s supermodel extraordinaire, and him, the big boss in&nbsp;the modeling biz. Fast forward to&nbsp;1993, the couple broke&nbsp;up.</p><p>Kyle MacLachlan’s life intertwined with that of&nbsp;Linda Evangelista when they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>crossed paths</a> during a&nbsp;shoot for a&nbsp;Barney’s department store commercial in&nbsp;1992. Their chance meeting reportedly hastened the end of&nbsp;Evangelista’s <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> to&nbsp;Gerald Marie, with both admitting to&nbsp;an&nbsp;undeniable, electric chemistry. By&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1995</a>, Evangelista openly expressed her desire to&nbsp;marry MacLachlan, but the two eventually announced their separation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/271/ee9/fbcbe45556bef8fe76fd70041e.jpg><p>Evangelista and Fabien Barthez, the famous French racing driver and former soccer goalkeeper, became a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>couple</a>. Their relationship, characterized by&nbsp;on-and-off dynamics, encountered a&nbsp;tragic turn in&nbsp;1999 when Evangelista faced the heartbreak of&nbsp;a&nbsp;stillborn child at&nbsp;six months. In&nbsp;the aftermath, Evangelista drew strength from her return to&nbsp;the modeling industry at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;36, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gracing</a> magazine covers and strutting runways for major fashion houses, challenging conventional age norms.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2006</a>, Evangelista, then&nbsp;41, announced her second pregnancy without disclosing the identity of&nbsp;the father. The mystery unraveled when it&nbsp;was revealed that Francois-Henri Pinault, the billionaire CEO of&nbsp;a&nbsp;luxury conglomerate, was the father. Despite reported tensions surrounding the pregnancy, Evangelista welcomed her son, Augustin James Evangelista, in&nbsp;October 2006.</p><p>Maintaining a&nbsp;guarded stance on&nbsp;Augie’s paternity, Evangelista later found companionship in&nbsp;Peter <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Morton</a>, a&nbsp;multi-millionaire restaurateur and co-founder of&nbsp;Hard Rock Café. Their paths crossed in&nbsp;2006, during Evangelista’s pregnancy, but the relationship concluded in&nbsp;2013.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;blended family with Salma Hayek</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c3a/b5f/3fa1b55381ba9f673e487d6a47.jpg><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;her romantic journey, she shared that, despite a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;mistakes, she feels she has been truly blessed in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. According to&nbsp;her, she has had great relationships, but she now realizes that not all relationships are meant to&nbsp;last forever.</p><p>Acknowledging the beauty of&nbsp;solitude, she further <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained </a>that she has had some incredible moments of&nbsp;being alone but also said that: “Initially you don’t think&nbsp;so. But great things happen when you’re alone.”</p><p>Evangelista also disclosed some insights into her remarkable blended family dynamic. She has a&nbsp;son ,affectionately called Augie, from her previous relationship with billionaire François-Henri Pinault. It’s noteworthy that <a href=# title="Salma Hayek" data-link=tag>Salma Hayek</a>, Pinault’s wife, and he&nbsp;welcomed their daughter Valentina in&nbsp;2007 and later tied the knot in&nbsp;2009.</p><p>In&nbsp;contrast to&nbsp;intricate custody-sharing arrangements or&nbsp;alternating holiday schedules, Evangelista shared that, rather uniquely, she typically spends holidays with the entire blended family, including her stepmotherly relationship with Hayek. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sharing</a> a&nbsp;sweet memory, the model recalled a&nbsp;moment from a&nbsp;past Thanksgiving: “I&nbsp;was sick at&nbsp;Thanksgiving and Salma got on&nbsp;the plane with her daughter, came here, and made Thanksgiving dinner.”</p><p>This showcases the collaborative spirit of&nbsp;two strong women working together to&nbsp;foster family connections and build stable relationships.</p><p><h2>She learned to&nbsp;raise her child without letting him feel the weight of&nbsp;her notoriety</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/443/c60/e88ba35428939c1e6b1efd85f0.jpg><p>Before Augie came along, Evangelista was pretty clear, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;will have children in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, of&nbsp;that I’m certain.” Then, motherhood took the stage, and she swapped the catwalk for strollers. By&nbsp;2013, she was all about&nbsp;it,<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> saying</a>, “Motherhood is&nbsp;everything to&nbsp;me&nbsp;now. It’s the best. I’m so&nbsp;fulfilled.”</p><p>Even though Evangelista kept Augie away from the public eye when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kid, now that he’s a&nbsp;teenager, she throws&nbsp;us a&nbsp;few glimpses. Augie isn’t big on&nbsp;social media, no&nbsp;public accounts, and you won’t see him much on&nbsp;his mom’s Instagram.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2022</a>, he&nbsp;tagged along with his mom to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fancy Fendi fashion show and the next year to&nbsp;the second annual Caring for Women Dinner. They rocked matching black suits, hand in&nbsp;hand on&nbsp;the red carpet. And for Augie’s 16th birthday, Evangelista shared a&nbsp;sweet post on&nbsp;Instagram with pics of&nbsp;their journey. The caption? “My&nbsp;heart. My&nbsp;light.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10c/1b3/73963a5ad9a830885e52c74226.jpg><p><h2>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mom, her top priority is&nbsp;her family</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/378/a42/8f6fe65a2cbf70ae1dbcd1a74c.jpg><p>ANDREA RENAULT/AFP/East News</p><p>Evangelista hinted that, aside from her modeling ambitions, her childhood dream involved creating a&nbsp;family where meaningful conversations could unfold at&nbsp;the dinner table, complemented by&nbsp;delightful meals. According to&nbsp;her, this vision has come to&nbsp;fruition with Augie.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;her own upbringing, she mentioned that her father didn’t encourage conversation at&nbsp;the table, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;sought peace and quiet after a&nbsp;day filled with the constant noise of&nbsp;working. In&nbsp;contrast, Evangelista, now navigating single motherhood, expressed satisfaction in&nbsp;discovering contentment within the simplicity of&nbsp;her family dynamic with Augie. She underscored this sentiment by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a>, “I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;single mother with a&nbsp;child—but that’s all you need to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;family, two people.”</p><p><h2>Linda is&nbsp;not interested in&nbsp;dating anymore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/721/468/24b5f7543e9e8cf86999c3f1ec.jpg><p>Rolf Mueller/face to face fot. Face to Face/REPORTER/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent interview Linda, 58, revealed that she has no&nbsp;plans to&nbsp;reenter the dating scene any time soon. Her candid remarks shed light on&nbsp;her current perspective on&nbsp;romance and intimacy. “I’m not interested,” she asserted when asked about her willingness to&nbsp;explore new relationships. Elaborating on&nbsp;her sentiment, she expressed a&nbsp;specific aversion to&nbsp;the idea of&nbsp;sharing a&nbsp;bed with someone, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a>, “I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;sleep with anybody anymore. I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;hear somebody breathing.”</p><p>The famous model went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;share insights into her past experiences, revealing that her last venture into the world of&nbsp;dating occurred “definitely before the Cool-Sculpting.” This reference alludes to&nbsp;a&nbsp;cosmetic procedure aimed at&nbsp;fat reduction. The model explained that the outcomes of&nbsp;the Cool-Sculpting sessions, which took place from August 2015 to&nbsp;February 2016, were far from positive. According to&nbsp;her, the procedure resulted in&nbsp;her feeling “permanently deformed” and “brutally disfigured.”</p><p><a href=#>Evangelista</a>’s decision to&nbsp;prioritize her well-being and comfort over societal expectations highlights the importance of&nbsp;self-care and self-acceptance, even in&nbsp;an&nbsp;industry often driven by&nbsp;external standards of&nbsp;beauty and relationships.</p><p>Preview photo credit Rolf Mueller/face to face fot.
