Jeff’s daughter, Emily, started her business several years ago. 
In&nbsp;2015, Emily Beaver transformed her passion for crocheting into a&nbsp;small business."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Jeff is&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;wearing everything and anything Emily creates, and he&nbsp;feels completely comfortable in&nbsp;his body. “My&nbsp;dad never really hesitated to&nbsp;help&nbsp;me,” Emily says. “He’s always been a&nbsp;huge supporter of&nbsp;me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;work.”</p><p><h2>Jeff’s input was really a&nbsp;breakthrough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e25/c0c/a7fe0f5f44ad6bb8bd55bc4955.jpg><p>Emily started crocheting specifically for herself, however, as&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> on&nbsp;her website, “I&nbsp;very much enjoyed seeing my&nbsp;creations on&nbsp;friends and the joy they got from wearing my&nbsp;art.” The first one to&nbsp;appear as&nbsp;a&nbsp;crop top model on&nbsp;Emily’s Instagram was her mother. When the video with her mother did well, Emily asked her dad to&nbsp;participate.</p><p>Jeff was happy to&nbsp;get involved. “The internet totally ate it&nbsp;up, and every time&nbsp;I included my&nbsp;parents, I&nbsp;knew that there was something special about the concept of&nbsp;a&nbsp;family wearing crochet tops together,” Emily <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shares</a>.</p><p><h2>And he’s not planning on&nbsp;stopping.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/55d/e3f/b3c9a45c3d979df4f8b05e38d5.jpg><p>The family business turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;successful that Emily quit her regular job and focused completely on&nbsp;crotching and content-making. Today, she has more than 30,000 followers on&nbsp;Instagram and more than 600,000&nbsp;on TikTok. Jeff is&nbsp;excited to&nbsp;stir up&nbsp;the interest of&nbsp;the audience even more. “My&nbsp;dad doing whatever it&nbsp;takes to&nbsp;sell my&nbsp;crochet tops,” Emily comments on&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> of&nbsp;her father climbing a&nbsp;ladder to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;picture on&nbsp;the roof.</p><p><h2>The prejudice they face doesn’t depreciate the importance of&nbsp;their business.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/899/834/65f56e531cac51d1f4e000dd6d.jpg><p>Seeing Jeff modeling, some people made fun of&nbsp;him and claimed it&nbsp;was inappropriate for a&nbsp;man to&nbsp;expose himself the way he&nbsp;did. However, Jeff and Emily “try not to&nbsp;take negative comments to&nbsp;heart,” as&nbsp;Emily explains. However, the amount of&nbsp;positive feedback beats it&nbsp;all. “It’s hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;negative about a&nbsp;family that has fun together,” Emily says.</p><p>“The most valuable part of&nbsp;our work together is&nbsp;the quality time we&nbsp;spend together laughing and making fun videos,” she adds.</p><p><h2>The Beaver family is&nbsp;getting used to&nbsp;the fame.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bd2/5f5/eb9d5c5030894559b83f6eb544.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was not hard for Emily to&nbsp;involve her parents in&nbsp;the content-making process. They were living together when she started her business, and the 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;them are quite creative. The passion they share helped them to&nbsp;quickly adapt to&nbsp;popularity and start enjoying&nbsp;it. “The attention is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fun!” Emily says.</p><p>“We&nbsp;never knew how big this would get, but we&nbsp;are embracing the excitement!” she adds.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about the Beaver family’s business? Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;passion you share with your loved ones?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5usMCdZKanlJq5tHnHoqpmnJGqtKnAxKuqZpuipLCpsdOem2aboqS9bsDOqapmmZ6Zeri1zaxkoZ2Rp8G0ec6nZK2glWK2r8DEq6WerF1tfXmDk3Bm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-riddles-to-test-your-logic-and-train-your-brain-802148.html><span>←</span><span>20 Riddles to Test Your Logic and Train Your Brain</span></a>
