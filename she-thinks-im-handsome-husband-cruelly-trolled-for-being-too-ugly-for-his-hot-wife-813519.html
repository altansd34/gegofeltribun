Scott, who is&nbsp;from <a href=# title=Texas data-link=tag>Texas</a>, and his wife, Divine, who is&nbsp;originally from the <a href=# title=Philippines data-link=tag>Philippines</a>, first met in&nbsp;2017 after<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> she sent him </a>a&nbsp;<a href=# title=Facebook data-link=tag>Facebook</a> message thinking he&nbsp;was someone else.</p><h2>Scott <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that before he&nbsp;met Divine, his life was pretty boring.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd7/aa3/5f1a075f20919e0f82e7203490.jpg><p>This mistake sparked a&nbsp;long-distance relationship which then turned into a&nbsp;marriage after he&nbsp;proposed to&nbsp;her during a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;her home country that same year. Nearly four years later, they tied the knot when Divine relocated to&nbsp;the USA. They had an&nbsp;exclusively online relationship throughout this period, but Scott visited his girlfriend <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>six</a> times.</p><p>Scott has been living with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scleroderma</a> since the age of&nbsp;13. It’s an&nbsp;autoimmune disease that<strong> </strong>causes inflammation in&nbsp;the skin and other body areas. Due to&nbsp;the disease’s aggressive nature, Scott spent most of&nbsp;his time at&nbsp;home, missing his high school and college years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e72/71c/fb92ca522b85b4d03cf30c9921.jpg><p>At&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>22</a>, he&nbsp;decided he&nbsp;was healthy enough to&nbsp;start working and finally try to&nbsp;do&nbsp;normal things. Meeting Divine motivated him to&nbsp;travel, despite doctors’ restrictions. They thought it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;impossible because his oxygen level was not good enough. But Scott proved it&nbsp;was wrong and flew to&nbsp;the Philippines 6&nbsp;times just to&nbsp;see the <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> of&nbsp;his life. Scott’s family <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agrees</a> that Divine has brought a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;light into his life, during their relationship, he&nbsp;became much more confident and happier.</p><p><h2>The couple has faced much negative backlash on&nbsp;social media for being together.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b9/2e2/f77fd65dc2a39d812583d76878.jpg><p>They started their <a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a> together in&nbsp;2021, but haters <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>refused</a> to&nbsp;believe they could ever be&nbsp;together. The most common <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>misconceptions</a> about their relationship are accusing Divine of&nbsp;just wanting a&nbsp;green card from him or&nbsp;that she married him because he&nbsp;was rich. But the couple only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>laughs</a> at&nbsp;it, claiming it&nbsp;was too long a&nbsp;journey for such a&nbsp;thing.</p><p>They recently made a&nbsp;TikTok video responding to&nbsp;a&nbsp;comment, “Wow. He&nbsp;isn’t cute at&nbsp;all. Come on. Be&nbsp;real with&nbsp;us.” To&nbsp;which Scott replied, “Guess it&nbsp;doesn’t really matter&nbsp;— she thinks I’m handsome.” Taking it&nbsp;even further, Divine said, “Yeah, what are you talking about, guys? My&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;very, very handsome,” she grabbed his face, caressing his cheek and giving him a&nbsp;huge kiss on&nbsp;the lips.</p><h2>The couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave</a> a&nbsp;recommendation to&nbsp;couples in&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-distance relationship.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d8/c17/d87b5b5193a1811867bb6d9a5b.jpg><p>“The only thing&nbsp;I can recommend is&nbsp;just to&nbsp;have patience because long-distance is&nbsp;hard, and you’re always going to&nbsp;make sacrifices to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;their life no&nbsp;matter how far away or&nbsp;what time it&nbsp;is,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opens up</a>&nbsp;Scott. “Trust the process,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adds</a> Divine.</p><p>Recently another TikTok couple named <a href=#>Alin and Maria</a> faced a&nbsp;negative backlash about their relationship due to&nbsp;the 220 Lbs weight difference. Alin admits that he&nbsp;even kept his girlfriend a ’secret’ for a&nbsp;year as&nbsp;he&nbsp;worried about what others will think. But now the couple openly shares their story on&nbsp;social media to&nbsp;prove that love doesn’t judge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCpsYytn6Kmm6h6qrmMoZinnKOkuqZ5x66qm5memXqkvtSeo6WxXam%2FsLjLnptmnp%2BneqOxyKeeZqyfpHq2s8uyZJ%2BnomK1qr%2BMoaatZaees6Z5l2pqbmlpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-amazing-reasons-why-scotland-is-so-family-friendly.html><span>←</span><span>Scotland offers so many family-friendly ways to make living and working here so special</span></a>
