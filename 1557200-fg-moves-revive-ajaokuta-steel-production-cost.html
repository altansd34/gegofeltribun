There is going to be reevaluation, auditing and more people are coming to ensure we get the best of all these. “Unlike the thinking of so many people, Ajaokuta is not obsolete but only requires the right attention to get the multi-billion dollar running again.”<h2>More promises from Tinubu government</h2><p class=align-left>Also Speaking, Shuaibu Abubakar Audu, minister of Steel Development, revealed that his team has a three-year plan to resuscitate the company.</p><p class=align-left>He added that when the company is ready, it will create over 500,000 jobs for Nigerians.</p><p class=align-left>The minister said:</p>"We would like to express our gratitude to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his visionary initiative in establishing a Steel Development Ministry.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a97b228ef31d5bde.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Reduce it to N1,500": Nigerians react as Dangote denies selling bag of cement for N2,400</span></p></a>"Over the last four decades, Nigeria has possessed the largest Steel Plant in the country, and one of the largest in West Africa, which unfortunately has remained non-operational. However, the President recognizes that in order to industrialize Nigeria, it is imperative that we rejuvenate the steel industry."To achieve this goal, we have compiled two essential documents: a three-year plan for the revival of Ajaokuta Steel Company, accompanied by a short to medium-term plan."One of the key components of our strategy is the roadmap to designate the 24,000-hectare land of Ajaokuta as an Industrial Park, and to establish a Free Trade Zone to further attract Foreign Direct Investment."My responsibility is to diligently address the persistent issues that have hindered the plant's production. If, during the first term of this administration, we can successfully produce even a small quantity of steel, it would mark a significant achievement."<p class=align-left>Audu further disclosed that he was on tour with potential foreign investors and experts interested in bringing FDI to unlock the sector’s potential.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d4840132f988dc97.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>FG to employ 5 million youths in renewed N-Power programme, Tinubu's minister shares details</span></p></a>“We have the Russians, Americans, Arabs and Chinese who are showing interest.

"Now, we are about to commit over $1.5 billion. Where is the accountability for what has been spent in the past before embarking on another potentially fruitless journey? I believe the government should consider completely selling it to a private company and cutting its losses."<h2>FG asks Nigerians to save money through bonds</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, in another development, the Federal government is inviting Nigerians to invest in two of its October bonds and has offered up to 12% interest rate.</p><p class=align-left>The offer is open to every Nigerian, and the <a href=# rel=noopener>repayment dates</a> have been set for 2026.</p><p class=align-left>The administration of President <a href=#>Tinubu</a> will use the bonds to fulfil some of its pressing needs while helping Nigerians to save and earn.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkr7a%2FyKecrKtdmrCwus6msGihnpnCtMDRsmZqbWVsf3F8jJ%2BeZqWfq7K0edGeraKulWKuq63OpKytmV2owaaxy2anq6eUqrC1tc6nZJyno6l8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1208107-how-test-girlfriend-loves-truly.html><span>←</span><span>Does she love you? 35 good and bad signs to test if your girlfriend loves you</span></a>
