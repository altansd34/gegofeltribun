Loved ones being there makes it&nbsp;even more special. But in&nbsp;today’s story, a&nbsp;father’s decision not to&nbsp;come has darkened the event. His missing presence felt like a&nbsp;major letdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64c/f9a/fe5f14512db7d0ddd3564de0bd.jpg><p>I’m an&nbsp;18-year-old guy graduating high school at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the month. Two nights ago, my&nbsp;dad broke the news that his stepdaughter, who’s 14, has an&nbsp;award ceremony for a&nbsp;competition she won, and it’s in&nbsp;another state on&nbsp;the same day as&nbsp;my&nbsp;graduation. She really wants him to&nbsp;attend. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;at&nbsp;both events and since his wife and their kids are going, he&nbsp;has to&nbsp;go&nbsp;too. He&nbsp;promised we&nbsp;could celebrate another time and that he’d make it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me.</p><p>I&nbsp;still live with my&nbsp;dad, but not for much longer. My&nbsp;mom passed away when&nbsp;I was&nbsp;7, and he&nbsp;remarried when&nbsp;I was around 11&nbsp;or 12. His stepdaughter never knew her biological father, so&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad took her in&nbsp;as&nbsp;his own and has focused a&nbsp;lot on&nbsp;her over the past 5&nbsp;or 6&nbsp;years.</p><p>This shift isn’t always obvious, but it’s noticeable. Our father-son time was put on&nbsp;hold, and instead, he&nbsp;said we&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;include her in&nbsp;our activities. He&nbsp;also spent time alone with her for father-daughter moments. When I&nbsp;brought this up&nbsp;to&nbsp;him, he&nbsp;said&nbsp;I wasn’t trying to&nbsp;get closer to&nbsp;her, and he&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;us all to&nbsp;bond, not just focus on&nbsp;my&nbsp;relationship with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/996/d37/c45a1157d7bcd07b1452e6488e.jpg><p>If&nbsp;my&nbsp;basketball games and her dance events happen at&nbsp;the same time, he&nbsp;always goes to&nbsp;hers, even if&nbsp;my&nbsp;game was scheduled first. When we&nbsp;go&nbsp;out for <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> days, and they let the kids choose the activities, he&nbsp;always picks her suggestions over mine. He&nbsp;says it’s because her choices are more fun for everyone, but he&nbsp;admits later that he&nbsp;just wants to&nbsp;make his little princess happy.</p><p>Our refrigerator and shower broke down simultaneously. With his stepdaughter’s birthday approaching, he&nbsp;used money from my&nbsp;birthday fund to&nbsp;cover the repair costs, ensuring she still got her desired gifts—a Barbie house and a&nbsp;fashion set totaling $250. When my&nbsp;birthday arrived, he&nbsp;hadn’t managed to&nbsp;replace all the money, so&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;the new monitor and keyboard he&nbsp;had promised, I&nbsp;received a&nbsp;$30 gift card. The monitor and keyboard were meant to&nbsp;go&nbsp;with the computer my&nbsp;grandparents had given&nbsp;me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7c/60e/8259a7591a85c0124624dd2eaf.jpg><p>When my&nbsp;dad said he&nbsp;would miss my&nbsp;graduation to&nbsp;support her, I&nbsp;told him that was something he&nbsp;couldn’t make up&nbsp;for and that he&nbsp;could forget about being part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life in&nbsp;the future. He&nbsp;promised to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I told him&nbsp;I was tired of&nbsp;always being second to&nbsp;his “little princess,” and&nbsp;I wasn’t okay with it&nbsp;anymore. I&nbsp;told him this was the last time he&nbsp;would push me&nbsp;aside. He&nbsp;pleaded with me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;reasonable, but&nbsp;I just walked away.</p><p>I&nbsp;then invited both sets of&nbsp;my&nbsp;grandparents to&nbsp;my&nbsp;graduation, and they agreed to&nbsp;come. His wife said&nbsp;I could join them and skip the ceremony to&nbsp;support “my&nbsp;sister.” I&nbsp;responded that her daughter isn’t my&nbsp;sister and&nbsp;I don’t want to&nbsp;support their family anymore. I&nbsp;added that I’d be&nbsp;out of&nbsp;their lives soon. She called me&nbsp;selfish and said&nbsp;I couldn’t deny her daughter a&nbsp;father.</p><p><h2>People in&nbsp;the comments completely agreed with him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/46b/510/2c6d80517ca6a6eee66434fa8c.jpg><ul><li>“There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;coming back from this. What other milestones does your father plan on&nbsp;missing for you? Wedding? Grandchildren? It’s better to&nbsp;cut your losses as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you’re able to&nbsp;and move on&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid other disappointing moments down the road. You are wise to&nbsp;catch this now instead of&nbsp;pushing it&nbsp;down.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>VictoryShaft&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“This is&nbsp;emotionally abusive behavior on&nbsp;their part, and&nbsp;I wish you every bit of&nbsp;luck and happiness in&nbsp;your future. I’m not sure when&nbsp;I started to&nbsp;realize&nbsp;it, probably in&nbsp;my&nbsp;late 20s, but you can create an&nbsp;amazing family without any bio connections. I’m sure you’ll find people who will care as&nbsp;much about you as&nbsp;you care about them.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>MeldoRoxl&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It’s his job to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for you. It’s his job to&nbsp;be&nbsp;your dad, and I’m so&nbsp;sorry he’s failing at&nbsp;that and doubling down when it’s pointed out. Don’t ever let yourself feel guilty for going to&nbsp;NC after this if&nbsp;you decide&nbsp;to. He&nbsp;decided you weren’t worth his time as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, so&nbsp;you’ve decided that he’s not worth your time now. That’s valid.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TheBerrybuzz&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Have you told your grandparents just how bad it&nbsp;is? They might be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;talk some sense into him and salvage something from your relationship with your father.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>squirrelfoot&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Please, don’t waste your energy. My&nbsp;mother never cared about me&nbsp;once her new husband came along, and my&nbsp;dad died when&nbsp;I was young. Your dad will never change, because he&nbsp;doesn’t see what he’s doing wrong.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>small***er&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Though the future is&nbsp;unpredictable, this situation has shown&nbsp;us that <a href=#>forgiveness</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;personal and complicated process. Right now, he&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;his achievements and lean on&nbsp;the people who have chosen to&nbsp;support him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecOam2aqlZvCtLHDZquoZZekerW7jKawZp%2BilrG2rdOipqdlkpqwosHSnmSonl2dtrR50q2cqZyRqrSpwMSrZKKulWK1orCMnqWorZedenl9mGtwb2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tv-personality.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Wright popularity &amp;amp; fame</span></a>
