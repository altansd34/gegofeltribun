The night ended with an incredible performance from 17-year-old Parijita Bastola, who turned all four coaches’ chairs and shared how historic it was for her to audition.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-parijita-bastola-turns-four-chairs-on-the-voice>Parijita Bastola Turns Four Chairs on ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Parijita performed “Jealous” by Labrinth, showing off a powerful voice beyond her years. John Legend turned around almost immediately, quickly followed by Camila Cabello and Gwen Stefani. Blake Shelton took a little bit longer to turn, but he eventually joined them.</p><p>The judges were shocked when Parijita shared that she’s only 17 years old. She also explained that her audition was historic, because she’s “the first Nepalese American to ever audition for The Voice.” She even gifted all of the coaches beads from Nepal.</p><p>The coaches made their cases for why they wanted to work with Parijita. Cabello told her that she performed her “favorite song that anybody has sung so far.” However, Parijita ended up choosing to join Legend’s team, inspired by encouragement from her family backstage.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ALL OF THE SEASON 22 ‘THE VOICE’ COACH GIFTS RANKED</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-camila-cabello-thinks-singer-is-shawn-mendes>Camila Cabello Thinks Singer Is Shawn Mendes</h3><p>Another notable moment from Tuesday’s show came when artist Tanner Howe took the stage to perform “Mercy” by Shawn Mendes. Cabello, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who previously dated Mendes</a> and recorded music with him, had a funny reaction to hearing Tanner’s voice.</p><p>“Is that my… Is that Shawn up there?” Cabello asked as she listened to Tanner sing. “I thought that was Shawn!”</p><p>Unfortunately, Cabello was the only coach who didn’t turn around for Tanner’s performance. She explained that she thought he “sounded a little bit too much like him.” Cabello encouraged him “distinguish yourself” going forward. Tanner ended up choosing to join Team Gwen.</p><p>The Voice will return for another episode next Monday night at 8/7c on NBC. The coaches’ teams are really starting to fill up.
