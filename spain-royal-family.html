<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Spains royal family: A guide to the Spanish monarchy</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Is there still a royal family in Spain? There sure is. As well as performing an important role in the country, Spain’s royal family makes regular appearances in glossy magazines across Europe. We’re here to give you a brief overview of the rich history of one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Europe’s best-known monarchies</a> — and speculate about what might come next for the Spanish royal family.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-history-of-the-Spanish-monarchy>The history of the Spanish monarchy</h2><p>The history of the monarchy in Spain is a long one. The main players we’ll focus on here belong to the House of Bourbon, the present rulers of Spain. The house traces its lineage back to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Philip V</a>, who became king in 1700, though the Bourbon dynasty has been overthrown three times since.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, in 1931, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King Alfonso XIII</a> went into exile when the Second Spanish Republic was declared. The Bourbons returned to prominence in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1975</a>, after the death of Francisco Franco, when King Juan Carlos I ascended the throne. Juan Carlos I shepherded Spain toward democracy and led the country into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">European Union</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1986</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Who’s-who-in-the-Spanish-royal-family>Who’s who in the Spanish royal family</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Felipe VI</a> became king in 2014 and remains at the head of the royal family as of 2023. Other prominent Spanish royal family members include Queen Letizia (Felipe’s wife) and their daughters, Leonor (the heir presumptive) and Sofía.&nbsp;</p><p>The former king, Juan Carlos I, abdicated the Spanish throne in 2014. He remains a well-known, though controversial, member of the royal family along with his wife, the former Queen Sofía.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-role-does-the-royal-family-play-in-Spain?>What role does the royal family play in Spain?</h2><p>Spain is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">constitutional monarchy</a>, and the royal family’s role is apolitical and neutral, with limited power. The Spanish royal family is a symbol of Spain’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unity and permanence</a>, according to the Spanish Constitution.</p><p>Still, the monarch does carry out some important ceremonial duties. These include the sanctioning of laws and the appointment of members of government on the proposal of the president. The Spanish monarch also commands the Spanish Armed Forces.&nbsp;</p><p>Family members take part in numerous public and private engagements and support various charitable and social causes. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Queen Letizia</a>, for example, is known for championing women’s issues and development aid.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-future-of-the-Spanish-monarchy>The future of the Spanish monarchy</h2><p>The future of the Spanish monarchy often sparks debate. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Controversies</a> surrounding former King Juan Carlos I have somewhat tarnished the institution’s reputation. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia’s efforts to modernize the monarchy and implement transparency measures provide some reassurance to the Spanish people.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Leonor</a> is also being prepped as a modern ruler for all of Spain. She finished high school in Wales and will complete three years of training with the Spanish Armed Forces. She speaks several languages, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish</a>, Catalan and English.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are also questions as to whether the monarchy really symbolizes unity, with many in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catalonia</a> and the Basque Country <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rejecting its authority</a> altogether. In 2020, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">poll</a> found that just over 40% of Spaniards wanted a republic, while just under 35% supported the monarchy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tradition and modernity</h2><p>The Spanish royal family remains integral to Spain’s constitutional framework and embodies a blend of tradition and modernity, at least with the present ruler, King Felipe VI. Members of the family have served as meaningful figureheads in Spain for many centuries, though for how long they will continue to do so is unknown. The future of the Spanish monarchy will undoubtedly continue to evolve as the dynamics of Spanish society change.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
