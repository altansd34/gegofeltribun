However, eventually, her family moved to Buffalo, New York. There is not much known about her parents or siblings. The future star went to Howard University, where she studied English literature, and her graduation was successful.</p><p class=align-left>Stephanie decided to move to Los Angeles when she was only 18 years old because she already knew that she wanted to be an actress.</p><p class=align-left>In Los Angeles, Stephanie joined the improvisational and sketch group "Upright Citizens Brigade". She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fell in love</a> with acting and improvisation, and the style in which her new group worked became appealing to her. She knew that this place was where she was meant to be. Stephanie has always been a funny person and had a great sense of humour, so it was vital for her to share it with other people.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cbfd4c47f634e08e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Jem Wolfie?

This theatre changed her entire life and career. Thanks to Stephanie's improvisation background, it is now easier for her to act, direct and write. It also taught her to listen to other people and stay present.</p><p class=align-left>The comedian has a lot of projects of her own, such as being the host of "Wild Horses: The Perspective Podcast". She also hosted a show called "Urban Adjacent", which was valued by many people.

Her love life is a fascinating topic. Stephanie does not hide that she prefers women to men, and she is married to the female comedian Tig Notaro, who she considers her soulmate. The love story of Tig Notaro and Stephanie Allynne deserves appreciation.</p><p class=align-left>Before meeting Tig Notaro, Stephanie Allynne identified herself as a straight woman. She has not tried to go on a date with another lady before, and only dated men, but none of them genuinely made her want to stay. However, when she met Tig, she instantly fell in love at first sight. In the past, she had no idea that she could have such deep feelings for someone of the same gender. She had a black-white perception of orientation, and put limitations on herself. When they became friends, Stephanie wanted to spend more and more time around Tig, and then it dawned on her that she is in love.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6b1ec6ef553ecdf3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Sheryl Underwood - the woman whose smile hides a lot of painful experiences</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The ladies first met at the set of "In a World...", and this was a difficult time for Tig because she only went through her mom's passing and the cancer surgery not so long ago. A year later, they ran into each other again and started dating very soon. It was unbelievable for Tig that after all the challenges that life gave her, she still met a fantastic person who wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with her.</p><p class=align-left>When Stephanie remembered the first time she realised her feelings for Tig are more than friendly, she said it was on Sundance. Tig was feeling under the weather, and Stephanie put her arms around her to comfort her. This was when she understood that she cares about this woman deeply. Stephanie always felt very comfortable with touching her, talking to her and being with her. Stephanie realised that before Tig she has never been truly in love with anyone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6521359a9bd70c3b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Young MA net worth as well as her life story will surprise you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The actress said that nowadays there are a lot of gay characters on television, but when she was younger, there was not enough of them. As she confessed, if there were more characters for her to identify with when she was a young girl, she might have realised her orientation sooner. After getting together with Tig, she understood that it is not a big deal who to like, as long as you are happy by this person's side. When she speaks about attractive women on television, she names Tammy from the show "Transparent" as her TV crush.</p><p class=align-left>Stephanie's family was fully supportive of her choice and said yes to her future with Tig. However, the actress often thinks of people whose families are not very supportive, therefore they have to give up their true happiness to fit in with the social norms. The actress had a bit of identity crisis when she discovered her love for her future wife, but eventually, she came to terms with it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ae1914b478d3ca98.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing facts about Gunilla Hutton</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Both were very confident about releasing the documentary that depicted Tig's life. When asked if they were afraid that they break up later and the documentary is still there, the spouses confessed that they have never considered breaking up because they were so compatible together. The movie included both happy and sad moments, and the two were quite nervous but also excited to share it with the world.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Mindy Cohn today: age, net worth, personal life, gay rumors</p><p class=align-left>Tig and Stephanie's relationship is based on mutual respect, but at the same time, they love teasing each other and joking around. When Tig dated people in the past, she confessed that they often took things wrong and got offended when she made harmless fun of them. But with Stephanie, she felt comfortable to joke about anything, and the actress never got upset by any of her remarks, because she knew Tig does not want to hurt her feelings. It sounds like both women are absolutely confident and have no underlying insecurities about their relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6fbc221a24ef6866.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sara Martins: how did her life change after the popular series Death In Paradise?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Usually, Tig and Stephanie stay at home to cook and work at the house routine together. Going out to eat is not the best way for them, because it means spending a lot of time in the traffic and queues. When they eat at home, it feels like they have a lot of time together. Even though Tig was on tour for a long time, Stephanie often went together with her to support her.</p><p class=align-left>When the two lovebirds got engaged after a long period of dating, both of their families were thrilled to find out the news. Their close ones even met in Mississippi to hang out together and plan the wedding, which was one of the favourite memories for the two. Coincidentally, the Supreme Court ruling came through the next day after they sent their wedding invitations, so they could get married officially.</p><p class=align-left>Their engagement date was January 1st 2015, and in October of the same year, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">they got married</a>.

She is not just a stand-up comic but also an actress, writer and radio contributor.</p><p class=align-left>For a few years, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tig Notaro</a> was involved in a courageous fight against breast cancer.
