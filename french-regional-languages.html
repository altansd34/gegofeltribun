<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>French Regional Languages | Lingoda</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>If you know a thing or two about France, you probably already know that the French take great pride in their language. As a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French language learner</a>, it’s easy to find your own appreciation for the language as well. But did you know that France is also home to a number of different French dialects and languages, some of which are quite different from French?</p><p>Ever since French became the official language of France, the country has worked hard to extinguish the reach and use of local and indigenous languages. In fact, it wasn’t long ago that school children were punished for speaking anything but French in schools and regional languages were banned from being taught.</p><p>As a result, many of these languages are becoming endangered. French learners are often unaware of just how many other languages are spoken in France. Here’s a glimpse of just a few of the different French dialects.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Breton-language>Breton language</h2><p>Breton, or&nbsp;Brezhoneg, is a Celtic language most closely related to Cornish. It’s spoken in the upper part of Brittany, known as&nbsp;Breizh&nbsp;in Breton.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UNESCO</a>, the language is severely endangered. It’s not recognized as an official language in France, but efforts are being made to revitalize the language in schools.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Occitan-language>Occitan language</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Occitan</a>&nbsp;is also called&nbsp;langue d’oc&nbsp;because the language uses the word&nbsp;oc&nbsp;for “yes” instead of&nbsp;oïl&nbsp;(now&nbsp;oui). The language is the most spoken regional language in France. It’s found in southern France, northern Spain, and in Italy’s Occitan Valley.</p><p>Once, Occitan was the lingua franca of southern France. Today, some of its six major dialects are listed as severely endangered and their dialects can be very different.</p><p>Though it isn’t officially recognized in France, it is a co-official language in Catalonia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Corsican-language>Corsican language</h2><p>Up until the 19th&nbsp;century, Corsican, also known as Corsu, was the official language of the island of Corsica. The language is closely related to the Tuscan dialect of Italian, though it’s also influenced by French. &nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the language holds no official status, but it is taught as a core subject in schools. The island is trying to revitalize the language and many advocate for it to become a co-official language on the island alongside French.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Basque-language>Basque language</h2><p>Basque, or Euskara, is unique in that it is the oldest living language in Europe. It existed before modern European languages and, as a result, is unrelated to any other language. It’s currently spoken in the Basque Country, which is located in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain.</p><p>Basque can sound similar to Spanish, but there are a few sounds and unique grammar points that make it&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">very different</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>The language isn’t officially recognized in France. However, it does hold official status on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Gallo-language>Gallo language</h2><p>Gallo is a Romance language that is spoken in both Brittany and Normandy. It is part of the Oïl languages, which is a group of different french dialects and languages that includes French as well as other local languages such as Picard and Norman.</p><p>Gallo is a severely endangered language according to UNESCO. It’s mainly spoken by older generations and is often considered an “incorrect dialect of French.” Despite this, there have been efforts to revive the language and it is currently taught at some universities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Alsatian-language>Alsatian language</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alsatian</a> is a Germanic language spoken in the Alsace region bordering Switzerland and Germany. It’s also the second most spoken regional language in France.</p><p>Like other regional languages, Alsatian has no official status in France. Still, some efforts have been made to reintroduce the language in schools. Meanwhile, the language is mainly used by older generations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Catalan-language>Catalan language</h2><p>The French department of Pyrénées-Orientales along the Spanish border is also known as Northern Catalonia. As you might be able to guess, the region has strong ties to the Catalan language and culture.</p><p>Though Catalan is the official language of Andorra and shares co-official status in Catalonia, it’s not officially recognized in France.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Cassie Wright</h2><p>Cassie Wright is a freelance writer and blogger living in the United States. After a bad experience with elementary school Spanish classes, she fell in love with learning French. Now, in addition to French, she spends a considerable amount of time learning Japanese and has jumped back into learning Spanish. Like many avid language learners, she plans to continue learning more languages than she has hours in the day. When she isn’t writing or learning, she loves reading, traveling, video games, and all forms of chocolate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3ynvsSnmqFlopq0qrvNmqNmpJGjtLatxp6qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1606075-el-clasico-newlywed-couple-spotted-heart-melting-video-real-madrid-barcelona-tie.html><span>←</span><span>El Clasico: Newlywed Couple Spotted in Heart Melting Video at Real Madrid vs Barcelona Tie</span></a>
