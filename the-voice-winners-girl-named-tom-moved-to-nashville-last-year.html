Group member Bekah Liechty shared the news on Instagram Monday.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-winners-girl-named-tom-moved-to-nashville>The Voice Winners Girl Named Tom Moved to Nashville</h2><p>On Monday, Bekah posted an Instagram story to Girl Named Tom’s account in which she shared, “So, we moved to Nashville a year ago, and we originally thought this room would be a great guest room for when our mom came to visit, or whoever.”</p><p>Bekah then showed the room she was standing in, which was full of boxes, a guitar case, and a rack of clothes. She joked that there was “no room in the inn.” Later, she also shared a photo of the siblings’ mom at the house wearing a Girl Named Tom T-shirt, writing, “girl named MOM.”</p><p>The trio, who won The Voice on Team Kelly back in 2021, is originally from Pettisville, Ohio. If it comes as a surprise that they moved to Nashville last year, that’s probably because the group has spent so much time touring.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE VOICE’ WINNERS GIRL NAMED TOM ANNOUNCE TOUR GUESTS, INCLUDING BELLA DENAPOLI</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-group-is-going-on-tour-this-year>The Group Is Going on Tour This Year</h2><p>Girl Named Tom spent much of last year performing for fans around the country before embarking on a holiday tour with the a cappella group Pentatonix.
