Hough was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently announced</a> to</strong> <strong>replace Ribeiro’s former co-host Tyra Banks for Season 32.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-bergeron-approves-of-the-new-dwts-hosts>Tom Bergeron Approves of the New DWTS Hosts</h2><p>On Monday, Bergeron shared an Instagram post featuring photos of himself with the new DWTS co-hosts. In one shot, Julianne Hough and her brother Derek (who is returning to the show as a judge next season) can be seen embracing Bergeron.</p><p>In another shot, Bergeron smiles for the camera beside Ribeiro. As Bergeron wrote in the post’s caption, “Glad the show’s in good hands. Their feet ain’t bad, either.” He added a mirrorball, winking face, and thumbs-up emoji.</p><p>Bergeron’s comment about the hosts’ feet is likely referring to the fact that both Hough and Ribeiro have competed in the ballroom in past seasons. Hough was a pro dancer from Season 4 to Season 8, winning twice. Ribeiro, meanwhile, was the winning celebrity in Season 19, with partner Witney Carson.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FORMER ‘DWTS’ HOST TOM BERGERON REVEALS WHAT HE MISSES MOST ABOUT THE SHOW</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bergeron-was-replaced-by-tyra-banks-in-season-29>Bergeron Was Replaced by Tyra Banks in Season 29</h2><p>Tom Bergeron hosted Dancing with the Stars from the first season until Season 28. After that, he and co-host Erin Andrews were replaced by Tyra Banks. Many fans were angered over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bergeron’s firing</a>, and Banks went on to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">receive backlash</a> for her hosting style over three seasons.</p><p>Ribeiro joined Banks as a co-host during Season 31 last year, as the show left its former network ABC and started streaming on Disney+. Last month, Banks shared that she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would not be returning</a> for Season 32 as she instead wants to focus on her business. Hough was later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced as her replacement</a>.</p><p>The cast for Season 32 has yet to be announced, although judges Derek Hough, Carrie Ann Inaba, and Bruno Tonioli will be returning to the panel. Longtime judge Len Goodman <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed last season</a> that he would be leaving the show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_Shakira_GerardPique_David-RamosGetty-Images.jpg alt="Gerard&nbsp;Piqué Responds to Ex Shakira Dissing Him Through Music" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaippp2iYrG4wNJmn6irpGLBsLmMm5yrn5WnvK95wKmnq6emmsBuu8Vmq6GdXaOyuHnHqKqtoZ6ceqXBzmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-have-stopped-wearing-pants-because-of-a-new-fashion-trend-813570.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Have Stopped Wearing Pants Because of a New Fashion Trend</span></a>
