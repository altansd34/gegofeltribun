The New York Mets, for example, attributed over 100,000 tickets sold each season to theme nights, which Andy Goldberg, the team’s executive vice president and chief marketing officer, described as “vital” to the franchise’s group sales efforts.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But a boost in ticket sales is not the only reason marketers, sales and sponsorship executives decide to dot their teams’ calendars with the likes of Pride Night, NASCAR Day, Star Wars Night, Top Gun Day or Hispanic Heritage Night. They can also promote diversity and inclusivity among their fan bases, help a brand reach a new audience and recognize a charitable cause, all while providing additional entertainment value for customers.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">New Morning Consult data found that 56% of self-identified U.S. sports fans are familiar with the concept of themed nights, with 37% saying they have attended such a game at least once. Among generations, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Gen Zers</a> were most familiar with theme nights at 62%, while baby boomers were the least aware at 35%.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“We view the impact of theme nights as not necessarily just being the tickets and the revenue that they drive on that particular night, but more so the engagement with the community, engaging new audiences and just diversifying the game experience,” said Nicole Freeman, the NBA’s vice president of team, marketing and business operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Sports theme nights 101&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When the NHL releases its regular-season schedule in the summer, marketers Jillian Frechette and Amanda Tischler begin to determine where their respective teams’ theme nights will fit into the typical 82-game slate.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“We’re just trying to figure out how to almost play Tetris with our calendar, overlaying those theme nights,” said Frechette, senior vice president of marketing for the New Jersey Devils.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">After months of preparation, both Frechette and Tischler, vice president of marketing for the Washington Capitals, which attributes 40% to 50% of group tickets sold in any given season to themes, start to piece the puzzle together. Colleagues across other professional sports leagues said they’ve encountered a struggle to decide which themes to pick.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“We want to be very selective with not doing too many theme nights because then it takes away a little bit of the panache from your typical experience,” added Gregg Allen, chief revenue officer for Sporting Kansas City, which has seven theme nights scheduled out of the MLS team’s 17-match regular season.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Complicating matters is the belief among executives that many theme nights require an “all-in” mentality. Some involved described a time-consuming approach that includes a thematic game-day presentation and in-venue experience, creative digital campaigns for social media and an overall robust marketing strategy needed to create the desired effect with fans. All of that, of course, requires money and labor.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That’s coincided with an ongoing conversation across leagues surrounding staffing resources, budget constraints, fixed expenses and opportunity costs, executives said. Even if teams wish to fill their home calendar with more theme nights, it might not be feasible.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“That’s a constant struggle to find that right balance of breaking up the monotony of a 41-game regular season and also not burning out your staff,” said Mike Forman, chief marketing officer for the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Forman estimated about 1 in 5 group tickets sold are related to a theme night. Some games, like Carolina’s Stars Wars Night, are successful each season, making it difficult to eliminate from the calendar. Forman admitted the organization has at times wanted to distance itself from Star Wars, but, “the proof is in the pudding.” More than 2,000 ticket packages are sold each season for the annual game, he said, good for No. 1 among the Hurricanes’ theme nights.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This past regular season, the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks held more than a dozen themed nights, including Pride Night and Greek Night, in honor of Greek-born brothers Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounmpo. Dustin Godsey, the Bucks’ chief marketing officer, said the two games were staples, in addition to the Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Fund Game, which moved from the preseason to the regular season for the first time this year.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Bucks sold out of full-season ticket memberships this season for the first time in team history, so the franchise had limited ticketing inventory to sell. Consequently, the Bucks viewed theme nights more as a way to add entertainment value and “make a memorable night for fans,” Godsey said.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The smaller-market Hurricanes, meanwhile, altered their strategy. Five years ago, Carolina aimed to turn a Friday or Saturday night near-sellout “good crowd” into a “great crowd” by attaching a theme night, Forman said.&nbsp; Now, in part because of the team’s on-ice success, weekend games are already near capacity, so the Hurricanes decided to place some theme nights during games the team expected would otherwise draw a smaller crowd, such as midweek games or ones against bad teams.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“We're trying to make 41 games big, as opposed to focusing on making those 10 to 12 games really big,” Forman said.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Sports fans most interested in Charity, Fan Appreciation Nights&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Out of a list of several popular theme nights options, self-identified sports fans expressed the most interest in Charity Nights, which recognize first responders, military veterans, nurses, teachers and essential workers and spread awareness for certain causes.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Roughly 2 in 3 sports fans (67%) said they would be “very” or “somewhat” interested in participating in a Charity Night, according to the survey, the highest share of any theme night among those surveyed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOrKeoqqSoerW0xKacZqaZnLW1v4yaq62dnpmur6%2FEZpqorpmZ</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./qa-julie-fedorchak-commissioner-north-dakota-public-service-commission.html><span>←</span><span>Q&amp;amp;A with Julie Fedorchak, Commissioner, North Dakota Public Service Commission</span></a>
