More than a third 37% say it’s because they cannot find an NHS dentist to take them on, with a further 5% on a waiting list, while another 23% say they’re not registered because they don’t think they can afford to be treated.</p><h3>One in ten Britons claim to have carried out their own dental work</h3><p>Among the most concerning consequences of Britain’s growing dental deserts is the willingness of some to attempt procedures they need but can’t get.</p><p>One in ten Britons (10%) admit to attempting their own dental work, with most doing so because they were unable, one way or another, to get an appointment with a dentist.</p><p>Of those who say they’ve tried to perform dentistry on themselves, most (56%) did so within the last two years, including 36% who did it within the last year.</p><p>Overall, that means 6% of Britons say they have tried their hand at doing their own dental work within the last two years.</p><h3>Britons report using cement and superglue on their teeth</h3><p>The survey revealed cases of people using cement and superglue to fix crowns and dentures, killing an infection with urine, using ‘heated polybeads’ to replace a missing tooth and applying chemical metal (an adhesive usually used for household or outdoor repairs) as a filling.</p><p>A third (34%) of those who revealed what kind of dental work they’d attempted say they pulled out – or tried to pull out – their own teeth.</p><p>A similar proportion (32%) gave themselves fillings, while others removed or repaired crowns (4%), tried their hand at a scale and polish (4%), filed their broken teeth down (3%) or treated their own abscesses and infections (3%).</p><h3>Why have Britons been attempting their own dentistry?</h3><p>One in five of those who attempted a procedure (20%) did so because they couldn’t get a timely appointment, with an additional 15% saying Covid-related lockdowns prevented them from getting one.</p><p>And 18% of Britons who tried their hand at dentistry say they did it because they couldn’t get registered with a dentist.</p><p>Among other reasons cited were fear of going to the dentist (14%) and an inability to pay for treatment (14%).</p><p>Of those who did so within the last two years, the most common reasons they did were because they could not get registered (22%) or they could not get a timely appointment (22%), while 18% say they could not get an appointment because of lockdowns.</p><h3>One in eight Britons have no confidence they can afford NHS dental care</h3><p>Amid an escalating cost of living crisis, one in eight Britons (12%) say they currently have no confidence in their ability to afford even routine NHS dental care. Another 11% are not very confident they can.</p><p>For emergency NHS treatment, confidence is lower still, with 32% not very or not at all confident they can afford it.</p><p>Confidence drops even further when considering private dental care, with at least half of Britons saying they are not very or not at all confident they can afford routine (52%) or emergency (57%) private treatment.</p><p>When it comes to getting timely dental care in an emergency, four in ten Britons (41%) say they’re not very or not at all confident they can get a routine appointment with a dentist when needed, and 37% are similarly unconfident when it comes to getting an emergency appointment.</p><h3>One in 12 Britons have avoided the dentist’s chair for more than a decade</h3><p>The NHS recommends routine check-ups at intervals of at least six months and at the most, two years.</p><p>And despite the ongoing problems in dental care, 46% of Britons say they’ve seen a dentist within the last six months, rising to 70% for those who’ve seen one within two years.</p><p>However, a quarter (27%) of Britons haven’t been for two years or more, including 8% who admit it’s been more than a decade since they were in a dentist’s chair.</p><p>Among those not currently registered with a dentist, the picture is more worrying – just 19% have visited a dentist within the last two years, while 31% say they haven’t been in more than ten years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGqBdnyMqKWeZaSau26u0aKrqKajYrWiwsRmp56qlqS%2FrrHDZpuepqSewLW%2B2GaroZ2dqLKtwsQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1557436-noah-lee-ritter-today-what-john-ritters-son.html><span>←</span><span>Noah Lee Ritter today: what is John Ritter's son up to now?</span></a>
