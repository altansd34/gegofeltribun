This performance marked the first time that fans have gotten to see Shelton’s wedding band up close, and the pair were positively giggly.</strong> <strong>Stefani even corrected Shelton when he called her by her maiden name.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-shelton-brings-wife-gwen-stefani-to-rehearsal-at-his-ole-red-venue>Blake Shelton Brings Wife Gwen Stefani to Rehearsal at His Ole Red Venue</h2><p>Shelton initially <a href=#>tweeted that he would be rehearsing at Ole Red </a>on July 15. The Voice coach will be embarking on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends and Heroes Tour</a>&nbsp;starting on August 18 in Nebraska. Shelton did not mention Stefani would be joining him for these rehearsals. Fans were given the surprise of a lifetime when they saw the “Slow Clap” singer at the venue.</p><p>Shelton strummed the guitar with his wedding band on full display. Stefani’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diamond sparkler</a> has been getting a lot of love online since the couple got engaged in October 2020. Seeing Shelton wearing a wedding band is equally as fascinating. They tied the knot in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an intimate ceremony</a> at Shelton’s Oklahoma ranch on July 3.</p><p>The couple performed several versions of her song “Don’t Speak” along with their hit duets “Happy Anywhere” and “Nobody But You.” The crowd buzzed with people professing their love for the pair. In one adorable blunder, Shelton introduced his wife as Gwen Stefani.</p><p>“I thought it was Gwen Shelton now,” she playfully said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This was also a cute moment, Blake was gushing about Gwen Stefani being in tishomingo and she said, “I thought it was Gwen Shelton now”.

Stefani is busy preparing for her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Las Vegas residency</a> at Zappos Theater this fall. They both played into the electric energy of the crowd and gave fans the dose of live music they have been missing.</p><p>“They were so happy and sweet with each other, like they were just in a little happiness bubble,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a source told E! News.</a> “He sounded so great and he’s always so kind and generous to the crowd, talking, waving and signing things.”</p><p>Though the couple is already back on their work grind two weeks after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the wedding</a>, they did take a few days off to celebrate. Many speculated whether or not Shelton and Stefani would go on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a honeymoon.</a> It looks like they had a local mini moon instead.</p><p>“After the wedding everyone left town and Gwen and Blake spent a few days on the ranch with just her kids,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a source said.</a> “It was really relaxing and they could let everything from the weekend sink in.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tyler-GoldenNBC.jpeg alt="‘The Voice’ Winner Todd Tilghman Releases New Single All About Healing" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>blake shelton</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Gwen Stefani</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWaclZfCtb%2BMsJydnJmjtG6%2ByKeeZpylp7avs4yoo55lopqxbrzEq52oqp2Wu6SxjLCgraBdnMSmuoysq56ekaO2cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1507092-bird-flu-kills-14000-pelicans-seabirds-peru.html><span>←</span><span>Bird flu kills almost 14,000 pelicans, seabirds in Peru</span></a>
