He first appeared on season eight of the Australian version of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The X Factor</a> in 2016. Riley made it to the live shows and was voted out during a quadruple elimination. Later, he returned to the screens with The Voice Australia where he ended up in third place.</p><p>Riley later competed in season 15 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a>, impressing the panel with his incredible vocals. Somehow, the pandemic hindered his journey on the show as he wasn’t allowed to travel to the US. He was, however, eliminated after his quarter-final performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>As a proud member of the queer community, Riley has been open about his struggles growing up. According to him, being gay set him apart from other kids his age, making “growing up a little bit harder.” Apparently, he used to blame his Asian genes for not appearing “more manly” and for not having “stronger” features.</p><p>Yet, as he continued to form an intimate relationship with music, he learned how to live “unapologetically.” Thus, when he began showcasing his unique vocals, people were in awe by his musical genius.</p><p>“A lot of people ask, ‘Is it pop? Is it jazz?’&nbsp;Orchestral dark pop is what I think it is. It’s really emotional but there’s so much light and beauty in it as well,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-competing-on-agt-fantasy-league>He’s Competing on AGT: Fantasy League</h2><p>Soon, Riley will take the AGT stage again for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT: Fantasy League</a>. In 2024, he’ll be gracing America once again with his mesmerizing sound. As he attempts to snatch the first ever trophy from the spinoff, fans are yet to see if his creative capabilities can</p><p>“The person that I’ve always wanted to look up to – that’s me now. I get to be myself, I get to walk around in the clothes that I wear. I get to sing the songs that I want to sing and I know that people are going to want to listen to them,” he said.</p><p>If you want to witness Sheldon Riley’s journey on the spinoff, be sure to tune in on the show. America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League premieres Monday, Jan. 1 at 8 p.m. ET on NBC and will stream the next day on Peacock.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_BrianJustinCrum_-Trae-Patton_NBCU-Photo-Bank_NBCUniversal-via-Getty-Images-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Brian Justin Crum, The Powerhouse Vocalist Returning to ‘AGT: Fantasy League’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWjnbKtsM6nZKuhnJrGbsDHnmSdmaKgerG7z2aqoqaXmr9uvsStrKummaO0brLOq2San6Ris6K605qqsmWcmq6owcRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./18255-manifesto-destinies.html><span>←</span><span>Manifesto destinies | YouGov</span></a>
