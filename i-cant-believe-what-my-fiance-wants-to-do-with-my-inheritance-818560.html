I&nbsp;became engaged to&nbsp;my&nbsp;partner, a&nbsp;35-year-old man, just a&nbsp;year ago. We’ve been together for 5&nbsp;years now, and our wedding is&nbsp;scheduled for May 2025.

She and my&nbsp;grandfather had worked tirelessly throughout their lives, achieving great success and financial stability."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We’ve been together for 5&nbsp;years now, and our <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> is&nbsp;scheduled for May 2025.</p><p>Sadly, only a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks after our engagement, my&nbsp;nanna passed away. She and my&nbsp;grandfather had worked tirelessly throughout their lives, achieving great success and financial stability. They were frugal in&nbsp;their younger years, allowing them to&nbsp;accumulate <strong>significant wealth in&nbsp;their later years</strong>. My&nbsp;grandfather, particularly, is&nbsp;exceptionally intelligent and skilled in&nbsp;managing <a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a> and investments.</p><p>In&nbsp;her will, my&nbsp;grandmother left a&nbsp;<strong>remarkably generous amount of&nbsp;money</strong> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;divided among&nbsp;me, my&nbsp;brother, and my&nbsp;three cousins. Even after dividing the money, each of&nbsp;us received a&nbsp;substantial sum. I&nbsp;prefer not to&nbsp;disclose the exact amount.</p><p>Upon hearing the news, I&nbsp;shared it&nbsp;with my&nbsp;fiancé, who seemed incredibly overjoyed, much more than&nbsp;I had anticipated. I&nbsp;shrugged it&nbsp;off, but the next day&nbsp;<strong>I overheard him talking to&nbsp;his friends</strong> during a&nbsp;gaming session, «I&nbsp;can pay my&nbsp;credit card off with that money, mate! We&nbsp;can finally get that boys’ holiday we’ve been planning!»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a28/ff9/1cbca858b1bccfcaf2314c3b34.jpg><p>I&nbsp;walked into the room and asked, «What money?» He&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange look and replied, «From your nan, babe.» That’s when&nbsp;I lost&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;told him firmly, «<strong>You won’t be&nbsp;using any of&nbsp;that money without my&nbsp;consent, and there’s definitely no&nbsp;boys’ holiday happening</strong>. It’s not your money to&nbsp;claim; it’s specifically designated to&nbsp;me&nbsp;by&nbsp;MY grandmother. It’s not up&nbsp;for debate.»</p><p>Our argument escalated quickly, with raised voices and hurtful words exchanged. <strong>I&nbsp;stormed out of&nbsp;the room, feeling upset and frustrated</strong>. Later, he&nbsp;stopped his gaming session to&nbsp;confront me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the kitchen, accusing me&nbsp;of&nbsp;embarrassing him in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;his friends and implying that my&nbsp;financial assets would automatically become his once we&nbsp;were married.</p><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t me&nbsp;who brought up&nbsp;the idea of&nbsp;a&nbsp;holiday, and his assumption that I’d be&nbsp;a&nbsp;financial burden is&nbsp;baseless, considering&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;stable <a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a> and no&nbsp;plans for children. Unable to&nbsp;bear the tension, <strong>I&nbsp;left the house without saying another word and sought refuge at&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend’s place</strong>, where I’m writing this.</p><p>I&nbsp;should mention that this altercation just occurred. Until now, I&nbsp;wasn’t even certain if&nbsp;I would receive the inheritance due to&nbsp;various <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and legal complications. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;at fault here?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a61/c38/a1c0e15309b7c5cc0a0aed7427.jpg><p>It is time to kick boyfriend out, you are not his ATM....</p><p><h2>Following the post, the woman received support from others.</h2></p><ul><li>I’d tell him you’re refusing your inheritance for now and see how he&nbsp;reacts.

How dare he&nbsp;assume that money will be&nbsp;his just because he&nbsp;exists in&nbsp;your life?
